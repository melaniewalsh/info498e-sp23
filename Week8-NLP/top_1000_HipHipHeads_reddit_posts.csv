EternaBoi,Did I just talk to Raekwon on the phone?,"[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/E4tQK3P) are the screenshots of our conversation.

So I was on Facebook and I scrolled to a post that said Raekwon changed his phone number. I thought it was for booking or whatever, but I was bored so I called the number. I didn't get an answer, but he texted asking who I was. Me, who probably should've just said that I'm a fan, said that I'm Kanye West. So he was pretty much like ""no you're not. You know what? I'm just going to call you."" So I frantically installed a call recorder app to catch the conversation that lasted under 30 seconds. He was nice as all hell considering I kind of adopted a jerky tone due to nervousness (?) and I was wasting his time. 

[Here's the call.](https://vocaroo.com/faDfc7ufPVW)

I have a hunch that since his Facebook page was recently hacked, Facebook made him give his number as some sort of a verification, but he accidentally made it public. Because like ten minutes after the call, I noticed that the number was taken down. I'm not going to attempt to call him back or whatever and I'm not giving the number up, because he probably feels annoyed already.

,Joey Bada$$ owes me money and it’s sad cuz I fw him sincerely :(,"[My story via twitter](https://twitter.com/acehashimoto/status/1108359002486796288?s=21)

As some of y’all know, my name is brandUn DeShay. I produced a lot of songs over the years but the ones we’re talking about today are “School High” & “Last Cypher”.

It's been almost 2 MONTHS since I heard from Joey Bada$$ yall....
I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt that he's a much busier man than me these days, but I've also reached out to his label management over the last 5 months and still no reply.

These beats I produced for Joey were done when I was 2 or 3 yrs in and for years these songs remained FREE mixtape downloads and I had no problem with that. I never asked for bread because technically no one was getting paid.

Until recently (December 12/23/18) Joey re-released the PEEP the Aprocalypse mixtape on all streaming platforms. Therefore generating bread off streams and DID NOT ask my permission, did not do splits or even work out a deal to just buy my share of the publishing from me.

To me, if you making money off the work/effort of another man, make sure that man eating too 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

And I hate takin shit like this public cuz usually i think that shit is corny asf... butttt I'm still tryna avoid taking this to court to retrieve the 💰. 

I hope Joey reaches back so we can figure this out... the ""producer x rapper"" relationship in Hip-Hop deserves some success stories.

Please retweet or share if this resonates at all.

EDIT: 

not to sound condescending but i'm just gonna add a couple of discussion questions here incase y'all get tired of 'father stretch my anus' jokes and lyric chains:

What direction do you think ~~this album is~~ these albums are going to take? What direction would you like to see them take? Do you think the length of the album is good or bad? What influences are we supposed to see on the album? Do you think he's gonna release it in time?


We know he's let Charlamagne hear some of it, and I believe Nas reportedly was working on something with Kanye too, what do you think it is? 

edit 2: 

why didn't kanye tweet the name of his own album? I'm assuming the second one is Kids See Ghost - Kids See Ghost

Why is ghost singular? do you expect both the drop? which one do you think will sell more?

mikejohnno,Kim is snapchatting Kanye's conversation with Taylor right now,"I'm gonna transcript these all for y'all.

EDIT: TAYLOR RESPONDED ITS FUCKING LIT: 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BH_TCz4DeSj/

*Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me 'that bitch' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. i wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for m, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I never asked to be a part of, since 2009.*

So first her PR team say there was no phone call, suddenly she never heard a certain part.

Also here's a better video of the snapchat story, credit /u/Pootrick2: https://flipagram.com/f/sfbgiK4bPf

**Every snapchat vid is Kanye talking to Taylor or vice versa over the phone.**

**Snapchat 1**  
Kanye: Oh ok do, you still got- you still got the Nashville number?  
Taylor: I do still have the Nashville area code but, I had to change it

**Snapchat 2**  
Kanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best... I feel like me and Taylor, might still have sex

**Snapchat 3**  
Taylor: I'm like, this close to over exposure  
Kanye: Oh, well this one is uh, this is a really cool thing to have uhh  
Taylor: I know! **It's like a compliment kind of**

**Snapchat 4**  
Kanye: .. give a fuck about... is just you as a person and as a friend, I want things that you feel good, I don;'t wanna do rap that makes you feel bad

**Snapchat 5**  
Taylor: Umm yeah I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way

**Snapchat 6**  
Taylor: I really appreciate you telling me about it! That's really nice.  
Kanye: Uh, yeah I just feel like I had a responsibility to you as a friend, I mean

**Snapchat 7**  
Kanye: I mean, thanks for being like so cool about it  
Taylor: Aww thanks, I really appreciate it, like the heads up is, that is so nice

**Snapchat 8**  
Taylor: Even asking or seeing if I'm being ok with it, I really appreciate, like I'd never had expected you to tell me about a line your song

**Snapchat 9**  
Taylor: The flowers that you sent me! I like, instagrammed a picture of them and its the most instagram likes I've ever gotten like 2.7

**Snapchat 10**  
Kanye: Relationships more important than punchlines, you know

**Snapchat 11**  
Taylor: Yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and think ""Oh that's a real bit, he must be crying""

**Snapchat 12**  
Taylor: You gotta tell the story like the way it happened to you and the way you experienced it, like you honestly didn't know who I was before that

**Snapchat 13**  
Taylor: It doesn't matter if I sold seven million off that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that, that's fine. 

**Snapchat 14**  
Taylor: And then you get (cant hear) that to make these things happen, and I have the idea to do it, and I create these things and concepts, it's like, I'm always gonna respect you

**Snapchat 15**  
Taylor: And I'm really glad that, you had the respect to call me and tell me about the song and

**Snapchat 16**    
Taylor: It's just like, it's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship so thank you  
Kanye: Thanks you too

**Snapchat 17**  
Taylor: If people ask me about it, it would be great to tell, well he called me and told me before it came out, jokes on you guys, we're fine

**Snapchat 18**    
Taylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade, but I'm gonna be on the Grammy red carpet and theyre gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me

**Snapchat 19**  - (I'm feeling like the FBI rn lmao)    
Taylor: ...awesome that youre so outspoken, they’re gonna be like “yeah she does, it made her famous.” you know. it’s more provocative to say “might still have sex.”

**Snapchat 20**  
No sound! Kanye isn't moving his lips so it's Taylor again talking but Kim must have messed up

**Snapchat 21**  
Taylor: It's not, *sighs* it's not, it doesn't matter to me, **there's not one line there that hurts my feelings**

**Taylor fans in dungerees n shambles tbh fam**

btw cheers for the gold lmao 

tonight has been a wild fucking ride...

Cry a bit, rap some more then pass out in the grass and text me a few hours like where we going next .. next five years I see this guy everywhere .. best people I could always count on.. we made a lot of music in my first studio in Burbank.. he kept getting better and better .. this dude lived so hard was so amazing and talented and still extremely missunderstood.. another video is me and @skrillex on New year's Eve at MSG and Mac just came out at midnight like he was he headliner in his Riddler suit. Fuck I couldn't stop laughing .. he was always there in the middle of the best moments .. and if there wasn't a vibe he created it and made the room brighter .. he radiated positivity, but there wasn't a balance.. the other side was he was deeply insecure and always found substitution for what was missing in his life .. For a second think about the people around you and make sure they are always aware of the love .. don't take a second forgranted. They might need you and you don't even notice it because your too busy .. always gonna love you Mac""](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bncn-NpgdZL/?hl=en&taken-by=diplo)

>Now I’ve been extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about Ye’& his antics... Partially due to the lessons learned from the outcome of other similar situations dealing wit my brother Wayne (which I admittedly mishandled a bit in hindsight) But now this shit is next level,futuristic Sambo,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!! From what I can gather... This is the most repulsive,disgraceful, 
Embarrassing act of desperation & auctioning off of one’s soul to gain power I’ve ever seen. Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally)... but bro... if ain’time I would’ve been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence,I feel that I’d be compelled to slap de’Fuq outta you bro For the People!!! You ass kissing and boot licking on a whole new level &I refuse to associate myself with something so vile,weak,& inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of ALL OUR PEOPLE!!!! I’m a true believer in “It ain’t what you do,it’s how you do it.” And this shit is regurgitating🤮! At one time it was a pleasure to work alongside you... now, I’m ashamed to have ever been associated with you.
To all the people who follow Ye musically,socially, or even personally....who are confused, heartbroken, infuriated.... Let me make this clear... THIS SHIT AINT COOL!!! THIS IS A MOVE YE MADE FOR YE!!! THIS IS A PLAY TO PUT HIM IN A POSITION HE’D LIKE TO SEE HIMSELF IN...WE ARE NOT ON HIS MIND AS HE MAKES THESE COMMENTS AND DECISIONS. Don’t follow this puppet. Because as long as I’ve lived I’ve learned that it benefits a man nothing at all to gain the world,if to do so he must lose his soul. We just saw Mr.West’s Soul on auction. If you listen closely you can hear the tears of our ancestors hit the floor. All I can say is... I’ve reached my limits. This is my stop,I’m officially DONE!!!! 🖕🏽Trump & His Lil Cookie Boy. #USorELSE✊🏽

In the span of his rants, he's claimed Drake bought out Pusha T's front rows in Toronto to cause a brawl, he sneak dissed him on SICKO MODE, Drake bullies people with mental health issues, only for Drake to end the first rant by calling him.

Kanye claimed 'Mission Accomplished' and the sample was not cleared. A couple hours later, Kanye is back and claiming Drake called to threaten his life, where he restated that XXX is dead and 6ix9ine are already in jail, only difference is Kanye is a family man. Kanye says he paved the way for Drake to come up in rap, and he shouldn't be giving the guy with pink polos the tough talk now. Essentially, respect your elders.

And then gives a further deep dive into SICKO MODE, calling out Travis for allowing that to come out as a diss to his brother-in-law. Retracts some of the harsher statements which are mirrored below, but then tries to end (as of now?) on a positive note, saying to respect him while he's still here.

eternallatake,"[DISCUSSION] Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus' ""Old Town Road"" is now the longest running #1 hit in Hot 100 history (17 weeks).","Now he has the longest running #1 hit of all time.

What do you guys think about this situation ? Do you think it's a big step for hiphop culture ? Do you think he deserves it ? Let's discuss, i wonder what y'all think.

Also:


1. It breaks the record previously held by ""One Sweet Day"" & ""Despacito.""




2. The song has now surpassed 1 billion streams on Spotify (all versions).




3. He is the first and only artist to spend 17 weeks at #1 on the Hot 100 with one track.




4. Billy Ray Cyrus is the first artist to earn a 16 week #1 single and a 16 week #1 album in US chart history.

The instrumental is quite similar and the subject matter, inflection, and flow is uncannily similar.

Redrapper,[SHOTS FIRED] Peep this fucking beef at my music school...,"Some background:
So I go to Berklee in Boston. I'm the second person to ever get in for rapping, so I'm blessed with a lot of really great opportunities and talent to work with. I've been working on a project since I got here I was supposed to release friday. 

Wednesday night, I get linked from a few band members this kid who I'd vaguely seen twice had written a diss track on me, posted it everywhere. All the class pages, the fucking secret Boston page, twitter-- everywhere. 

Here's that: https://soundcloud.com/kiswamusic/back-and-forth

I STRAIGHT UP THOUGHT THIS HAD TO BE SOME FUCKING JOKE. The times I had seen this dude, I'd been super fucking nice to him. I'd seen him a week earlier like ""yo, lets chill and catch up. No business for once."" I thought this dude was trying to just get people hype. So I write a quick 16 response but don't record it yet. Then he decides to post all this shit on Facebook like ""Zaid's a bitch"", walk around campus talking a mess of shit about me. Keep in mind, Berklee is a big fucking music school-- a lot of these people get jobs in the industry-- it's a huge networking hub. That's my reputation he's DIRECTLY impacting. SO I write a fuck ton more, we get the three best producers in the school to collab on the track and respond: 

https://soundcloud.com/zaidtmusic/the-last-supperkiswa-diss

1 for 1. Did it that night, we got a studio and recorded it.

Here's the thing. I had no idea how big of a fucking deal this was around Berklee. Fucking teachers were asking students about it. Everybody was talking about it. I straight up walked into the 150 lobby to applause yo. There's meme's of this dude on a bunch of peoples profiles with his face photoshopped on a fucking cucumber. 

http://imgur.com/jgcWGP7

11am I receive a text from said bodied motherfucker going like

""It was a publicity stunt. Nothing personal, just wanted to see how I could manipulate a fanbase""

LOL. foh. I told him to take the L and apologize for some stupid shit he couldn't deal with. He's like ""nah, best decision I ever made"". I'm like ""STRAIGHT"". Ima be real, I started battling a long ass time ago, and there are motherfuckers who understand where they're at-- take the L and squash, and people too stupid to understand it. Everytime I've lost a battle, I've been real about it like ""yo, good shit, I'ma come back harder."" I leave it be. But this dude too stupid to see that not only did he burn one bridge, he burned pretty much all of them at this school because he started some unnecessary shit. And then came around and started messaging people 
""oh no I didn't mean it!""

idk, i just wanted to share with ya'll some hilarious shit, because I've popped up on here a couple times, and I thought it was worth the story. And the dude does look like a motherfucking cucumber. 

TL;DR: I go to Berklee for rapping and some kid wrote a diss track on me. I responded. A lot of people knew about it. Now everybody talks about how this kid looks like a cucumber. And I posted it here because I thought it was funny, and ya'll are family. 

**UPDATE: HOLY SHIT! HAD NO IDEA YA'LL this was gonna get so big. Appreciate the praise, criticism, all that. My project is dropping monday or tuesday, pm me and i'll shoot you a link. and here's a link to another song I did a few months back: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3MAsOrOxg**

illshowyougoats,Toxic sexism in this sub,"I don’t know if shit is getting worse or I’m just becoming more aware of it, but the wildly blatant sexism and ignorance on this sub is extremely toxic. 

I know that this sub is nearly all men, young men especially, and it’s truly painful to see how threads play out when the post is centered around a woman (for example the threads on Megan getting shot).

Anyone with me on this? What can we do about it? It’s so draining being a woman who frequents this space. I’d like to continue spending time on here cause it’s a great place to discuss hip hop but damn I’m about ready to unsubscribe and move on.

Edit: while we’re here let’s also talk about the racism that oozes from this sub whenever issues of race are brought up

Edit 2: y’all are really focused on the ONE example I gave. Sexism runs deep in a wild number of threads.

lilsunny423,"Ayeee I’m Isaiah Rashad, my album just dropped…The House Is Burning, mk sure to check it out.🌞","To me, the title sounds like a book—not a rap album. I’m really writing my life. The world’s on fire, but nobody cares. It’s an observation. The House Is Burning, so are you going to run in there and get your trophy from a couple of years ago and those shoes you like? Or, are you going to move on? Can you grow for yourself? Am I going to sacrifice myself for some old shit? No, I’m going to move on. 

Music is where I go to express myself. It’s what I do to close a chapter. You know what’s crazy? I’m not even ashamed to say it...I really think my albums aren’t different from each other. Eventually, one of my albums will become a classic. I just love this shit. It’s me.

# Apple Music Description

Ever since The Weeknd emerged in 2011 with the mysterious and mesmerizing House of Balloons, the Toronto native has kept us on our toes: There was a trio of druggy, lo-fi RnB mixtapes, the Top 40 cake-topper “Can’t Feel My Face,” and the glossy, Daft Punk-assisted rebirth that came with 2016’s Starboy. On After Hours, his fourth studio album, the singer returns to early-era Abel Tesfaye—the fragile falsetto, the smoky atmospheres, the whispered confessions. But here, they’re bolstered by some seriously brilliant beatmaking: muted, shuffling drum ’n’ bass (“Hardest to Love”), whistling sirens and staccato trap textures (“Escape From LA""), and flickers of French touch, warped dubstep, and Chicago drill that have been stretched and bent into abstractions. It’s as if Tesfaye spent the past four years scouring underground warehouse parties for rhythms that could make his low-lit RnB balladry feel hedonistic, thrilling, and alive. When the album does lift into moments of brightness, they’re downright radiant: “Scared to Live” is sweeping and sentimental, fit for the final scene in a romantic comedy, and “Blinding Lights”—a Max Martin-produced megahit boosted by a Mercedes-Benz commercial—is about as glitzy, glamorous, and gloriously ’80s as it gets.",1584676585.0,,2210,/r/hiphopheads/comments/floa7j/fresh_album_the_weeknd_after_hours/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/floa7j/fresh_album_the_weeknd_after_hours/,10968,0.98

SlyFisch,PSA: Don't go see Smokepurpp,"Damn. I can't believe I'm writing this. I also don't know why I'm so surprised. But... Here we go.

I've seen a lot of hip hop shows, a lot of underground acts and this was the first show I was going to see a ""mumble rapper"". After seeing all his show footage it seemed like it'd be madness and I been following Lil Purp for over a year now. So we went to Starland Ballroom in NJ last night to go see him. Not only did I sit through 3 and a half hours of the worst openers I've ever seen, but the DJs were playing obnoxiously long sets with Lil Pump, XXX, and Ski Mask on repeat... but they were the same 3 songs. That's Okay, I thought, it's basically time for Smokepurpp.

Not only did they keep saying one more song. Then three more songs and he'll come out.... He came out late as hell and he was leaning and geeked so hard.

Here's his set list (did not play any of these all the way thru):
Audi,
Geek A Lot,
Bless Yo Trap,
Drop,
Fingers Blue,
Audi (again)

What the fuck. I sat through 3.5 hours for a fucking 15 min set... where he played Audi twice. Not to mention 2 other songs he played in his set were Uzi and Waka songs.

Aftwr taking so long he said ""theres no rules for lil purpp""... I feel like I was finessed by an artist I actually really fuck with. I'm pretty tight. 

Tl/dr; Smokepurpp doesn't give a fuck about his fans dont go see him. Go see an artist that'll put on an actual show. 

EDIT: I am not saying fuck Smokepurpp I still think the dude makes enjoyable music, just a little warning to anyone thinkin about spending time or money at one of his shows.",1514476734.0,,1760,/r/hiphopheads/comments/7mne7z/psa_dont_go_see_smokepurpp/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/7mne7z/psa_dont_go_see_smokepurpp/,10468,0.97

saisenberg,[ORIGINAL] Python program that writes randomly-generated rap songs,"Hey all!

I hope this isn't breaking the HHH rules, but here goes - I wrote a Python app that uses Markov Chains to write its own randomly-generated rap songs (based on *real* rap lyrics that I scraped from RapGenius).

Hope you enjoy - check it out! The app has some memory and timeout issues, but I'm working to fix them. Happy to answer any questions!

EDIT: Looks like it got Reddit-hugg'd-to-death. I'm trying to clear some memory to get the app back up. Glad everyone's liking it!

EDIT2: Wow, thanks a ton for all your support. I'm honestly pretty blown away - was not expecting this level of feedback. Apologies for the app still being finicky!

MattyRaz,"R. Kelly's former lawyer calls him ""guilty as hell,"" made him take ""libido-killing shots"" and re-wrote ""Ignition"" to avoid conviction","Kelly's former lawyer, Ed Genson, is retired and basically on his death bed and all out of fucks to give. The [*Chicago Sun-Times*](https://chicago.suntimes.com/?post_type=cst_article&p=1920405&utm_campaign=ChicagoSunTimes&utm_content=1551998192&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) has a really interesting [interview](https://chicago.suntimes.com/?post_type=cst_article&p=1920405&utm_campaign=ChicagoSunTimes&utm_content=1551998192&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) with the guy who represented R. Kelly in his 2008 child pornography trial.

In addition to calling his former client ""guilty as hell,"" he details some extreme and surprising measures he took to help keep Kelly ""out of trouble for 10 years."" Here are some choice excerpts:

>*“He was guilty as hell!” Genson said. “I don’t think he’s done anything inappropriate for years. I’ll tell you a secret: I had him go to a doctor to get shots, libido-killing shots. That’s why he didn’t get arrested for anything else.”*

&#x200B;

>*That’s why, Genson said, he knew Kelly was attracted to young girls. Because of lyrics Genson kept Kelly from using.*  
>  
>*“I was riding in the car, listening to a song and said, ‘Are you crazy? This is all I need.’ He re-wrote it.”*  
>  
>*Which song?*  
>  
>*“Ignition,” Genson said. “It’s a song related to a guy driving around in a car with his girlfriend. It was originally a high school instructor in a class teaching people how to drive a car. I changed the words.”*

Does Ed Genson deserve a song-writing or production credit for ""Ignition?""

EDIT: Son of Super-Lawyer weighs in: 

>*Genson’s son, Morton Genson, said Friday that he believed his dad wasn’t thinking clearly when he gave the interview at his home in Deerfield, Ill.*  
>  
>*He said his dad has been “in and out of the hospital” and returned for another stay shortly after the interview a few weeks ago.*  
>  
>*“He’s on a tremendous amount of medication,” Morton told the Daily News Friday when asked about the comments.*

Apple Music description:

> In the two years following the August 2018 announcement of Playboi Carti’s Whole Lotta Red, you could have gauged any given Carti fan’s investment in the project by which song leak they claimed to have liked the most. One the internet took to calling ""Kid Cudi"" had a unique sort of staying power. That song does not appear on _Whole Lotta Red_, but Kid Cudi himself does, on ""M3tamorphosis"". Of the project’s 24 songs, Cudi is one of three featured guests, appearing alongside likewise stylistic innovators Kanye West and Future. And so goes the story of the project: Whole Lotta Red is likely pretty close to what fans were expecting, but better. The production—provided by names like Pi'erre Bourne, Art Dealer, F1lthy, Juberlee, Richie Souf, Maaly Raw and Wheezy—is consistently forward-thinking, toeing the line between 808-heavy post-trap rumble and the perpetually weird and increasingly popular avant-pop sound known as PC Music. There is less ""baby voice"" here than fans of Die Lit may have wanted, but the rapping (and singing) is some of Carti's most impassioned and sharpest. Fans hung up on those early leaks might do well to consider them accidental gifts, because when it was time to deliver the album, Carti made sure we got the best of him. He just needed us to be patient.",1608871745.0,,5314,/r/hiphopheads/comments/kjtb3d/fresh_album_playboi_carti_whole_lotta_red/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/kjtb3d/fresh_album_playboi_carti_whole_lotta_red/,10328,0.94

theofficialtone,Examples of Kanye West making us hear lyrics that weren't actually in the sample,"# Update: We made this post into a YouTube video! Check it out here: [https://www.unspottedmusic.com/videos](https://www.unspottedmusic.com/videos)

Though not the only one to do this, I don't think any producers have come anywhere close to Kanye when it comes to tricking us into hearing different lyrics in the sample than are actually being sung. Here are some of the best examples and a link to my full post with the original samples: [https://www.unspottedmusic.com/music/which-one](https://www.unspottedmusic.com/music/which-one)

""Through the wire"" is actually ""Through the fire""

In Late, ""I'll be late for that"" is actually ""I'll erase away""

In Roses, ""I smile when Roses come to see me"" is actually ""I smile when Rosie comes to see me""

""30 hours"" is actually ""where the islands go"" < probably the weirdest one that somehow works

""Drunk and hot girls"" is actually ""Drunky hot bowls""

&#x200B;

\*Edit 1: Thanks everyone for the positive comments - this is the first [post](https://www.unspottedmusic.com/music/which-one) on my blog I launched just an hour ago so I really appreciate it.

To answer some of the questions here, the post I linked to explains how this is done. In some cases, he layers on top vocals to change the meaning (Late, Roses); in others, just the title of the song tricks us into hearing what he wants us to hear (Through the Fire, Drunk and Hot Girls).

If you're into more like this, the [blog](https://www.unspottedmusic.com/) has a couple other posts like the [Bill Withers song](https://www.unspottedmusic.com/music/bill-withers) sampled by almost every prominent hip hop artist now, and will have more coming along these lines. Let me know what else you'd like to see on the site and consider subscribing to the newsletter.

&#x200B;

\*\*Edit 2: In All Your Fault with Big Sean, ""Lit for your love"" is actually ""live for your love"" - credit to u/rios_salvi for this one

\*\*\*Edit 3: These suggestions have led me down another rabbit hole and I've added 5 more examples of this to the [blog post](https://www.unspottedmusic.com/music/which-one) including Glory, Gone, and Lost in the World.

Seems like Kanye has his friends and family out at the ranch to help him out. Hopefully they can convince him to get some help and go on his meds. 

**Celebrity Reactions:**

070 Shake: When ye is gon ya gonna realize he wasn’t crazy, just misunderstood by the people 
Like most geniuses that are ahead of there time

YesJulz: We love you @kanyewest ! We could never understand what it’s like to be in your shoes. Not one single person on this earth could. Just know we are here and support you. You are never alone 💯

Halsey: No jokes right now. I have dedicated my career to offering education and insight about bipolar disorder and I’m so disturbed by what I’m seeing. Personal opinions about someone aside, a manic episode isnt a joke. If you can’t offer understanding or sympathy, offer your silence. A lot of people you know probably have bipolar disorder and you aren’t aware of it. Taking this opportunity to make offensive remarks and villify people with mental illnesses is really not the way to go...this is the exact triggering shit that causes people to keep quiet about it. you can hate someone’s actions or opinions without contributing to stigma that damages an entire community of sometimes vulnerable people all for a couple of laughs. If you wanna think someone is an asshole, go ahead. Lots of people with mental illnesses are great. Lots of them are assholes. Because they are people. With nuanced personalities. But making jokes specifically targeted towards bipolar hurts more than the 1 person ur angry with.

TheDalkingWead,J. Cole (and his team) continues to gyp his fans out of merch for over 1 year,"I purchased an official, limited edition, autographed vinyl of J. Cole's KOD three days after the album first dropped from [https://www.jcoleshop.com/](https://www.jcoleshop.com/). It is now June 2019, and I never received anything in the mail for this purchase. I received a shipping confirmation email on April 24th, 2018 and an email ""Update Regarding Your Order from J. Cole"" on September 14, 2018.

In that update email, someone from J. Cole's merch team said that ""the signed LP jackets were damaged in transit and need to be re-manufactured and re-signed"" ... ""and these will now not ship out until late January 2019. We recognize that this is a long delay so if you would prefer to have your money refunded, please reply to this email to start that process.""

I am a college student, so I quickly let this slip my mind and I forgot about it, until I randomly remembered earlier this month (June 2019) and decided to email the merch team asking for any updates. In his merch team's defense, I did receive a quick response (on June 7th, 2019), but it was not very helpful. All they said was that ""unfortunately, we still do not have a confirmed timeline of when we will be receiving more inventory of the KOD Signed Vinyl.""

They did also offer, again, to provide a refund, but I am a broke college student, so the likelihood of me being able to afford VIP tickets to get an autograph from one of my all-time favorite artists is little to none right now. I don't really want a refund. The $37 I paid is not going to change my life right now, but I would really value adding this vinyl to the little collection I'm starting to build up.

Please spare an upvote so that MAYBE some slight social media traction might provoke a more timely-effort to give J. Cole's supporters what they deserve. I can guarantee I am not the only one that this happened to.

**\*Edit:** This is the contact email that was provided to me in my confirmation email: [jcole@fhcustomercare.com](mailto:jcole@fhcustomercare.com). Also, there have been plenty of reports in this thread about how you don't get the full refund for your order (because, for example, they technically ""shipped"" out the digital download of the album).",1561005109.0,refunds offered,979,/r/hiphopheads/comments/c2ricg/j_cole_and_his_team_continues_to_gyp_his_fans_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/c2ricg/j_cole_and_his_team_continues_to_gyp_his_fans_out/,9579,0.94

Vo1ture,After six years I finally finished my hiphop illustrative card deck. I want to share it with you all and say thanks.,"Hey everyone, in the past six years you’ve probably seen me around on r/hiphopimages or r/freshalbumart sharing my work, or the occasional times I actually stop lurking and post here. I want to give a big thanks to all of the content that is posted here (this includes the shitposting). It’s helped me find inspiration and links to new music. Six years ago when I was a junior in college, I created my first hiphop illustrations of Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West. After I finished ten of them, I thought it would be sick if I made three more and turned them into a card deck! So I did that which you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/RNC84 ). These were hand printed and cut (fun senior project). At this point I knew that I wanted to create a full 52 card deck. I just didn’t know it would be five years later lol.

This has kind of been my passion project after work. I’ll spend a few hours here and there, and some weekends working on this. It’s not my full-time job, but I just enjoy creating and this has been an outlet for me. 

Here’s a link to the full deck: 

[Hiphop illustrative card deck](https://imgur.com/gallery/AgDMsvu)

Breakdown of which artists are on which card:

[Breakdown Cards](https://imgur.com/a/EmZkXqn)

I need to give a very large shoutout to my friend [Parker Gibson](https://www.instagram.com/helloparkerg/) whom I collaborated with on the Vince Staples, Freddie Gibbs, and Pusha T piece. As well as a shout out to [Frawgsy](https://www.instagram.com/frawgsy/) for working on the Ski Mask piece with me. These are both talented artists worth following. 

Also I do have these for sale on my site [Brandonspahn.com](https://brandonspahn.com/shop/), but I don't want to make this post focused on that. I’m just really proud of this work as I’ve spent between 600-800 hours of my life working on it, and I wanted to share this link in case someone is interested. I set up a promo code for Reddit though, if you use “Reddit”, you’ll save 10%. I talked with the mods to make sure that this was okay to post as well. If you'd like to see more of my work or more detailed shots of the art, my instagram is https://www.instagram.com/brandonspahnart/.

Anyways thanks again for this subreddit, it’s the only one I’ve been active on for all eight years of my Redditing.

demonicneon,This sub has gone downhill,"One of our fine mods has suggested we move to www.hiphopheads.com 

Thanks, zigzigzag

Final edit: this got out of control! I went to sleep last night and this has blown up. I just want to make everyone aware the mods spoke to me and let me know that this is out of their control in large part - reddit made it a main page sub if you like the “music” tag on mobile reddit. Since then there’s a large influx of low quality users. Just wanna thank the mod team for the work they put in, and let them know that we appreciate all the work they did building this sub into a worthwhile community. A community so good reddit want to have it front page. Unfortunately being so popular seems to be a double edged sword. Let’s help them out and try and make some quality posts for them to mod. 


Where have the in-depth discussions gone? Why is every post either \[VIDEO\] or \[FRESH\] and of super popular artists? We all have spotify, we all listen to rap caviar, we all keep up to date. Are we heads or juts imply people who love pop? Would be great to see actual album discussions, highlighting up and comers, some underground stuff and artists we don't know. I know its difficult to keep the integrity of a sub when it grows to such a size, but this place used to be at leasta tiny bit relevant/useful/interesting and now it's just a carbon copy of XXL's insta feed and the top 10 rap songs on whatever music service you use.

I don't know about you guys and girls but I used to come here daily and now I barely check in every two or three weeks.


Edit: I just want to make clear I do appreciate the work mods do to try and keep this a decent and civil place. I understand it’s a thankless job and you do it for free. Happily chuck my hat in and say I’d be glad to help. Just because I’ve had great chats here with people and some decent insightful knowledge and thoughts and it’s sad to see it being diluted, whether that’s through too many newcomers or too many young people who don’t give a fuck (same can be said for some olders too don’t want to paint everyone with one brush there’s obvs youngers looking to engage as well).

Edit 2: I’m sorry if it’s not nice to hear for some of you. I’ve clearly hurt one or two egos and it wasn’t my intention. But reaction to the post seems to confirm my thoughts and there’s lots of interesting discussion on possible changes. Again appreciate the work that’s done by mods but it doesn’t mean we should stop improving. I want to be more active here, it was just a sharp and sudden drop off in quality that I saw that made me stop coming as often. As others have mentioned, it would be nice to not have to look through hundreds of comments to find interesting discussion and to be able to go back and read it more easily (harder to do when its comment threads and not text posts). 

I’ll be the first to admit yeah maybe I miss some stuff. I’ll put my hands up and say I could be more active. 

That’s what I’m doing now. Mods giving hate, it’s a real good advertisement of the kind of culture here. I want to help make a change. It’s not really great being abused for that.",1577058878.0,Quality Post,1118,/r/hiphopheads/comments/eece4c/this_sub_has_gone_downhill/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/eece4c/this_sub_has_gone_downhill/,9282,0.95

**Background** by u/A_Wavvy_Dude


Kids See Ghosts is an American hip-duo consisting of two of the most important and influential artists of this generation: Scott Mescudi, also known as [Kid Cudi](https://i.imgur.com/UCzqoEv.jpg), and [Kanye West](http://i.imgur.com/oB2WbVy.jpg). You know who they are. Kanye and Cudi's relationship is complicated to say the least, full of meteoric highs and heartbreaking lows, and the lead up to the formation and release of Kids See Ghosts is no different. 

Kanye and Cudi would first begin working with each other in 2008, thanks to Kid Cudi catching Kanye's attention from the release of his massively successful debut single ""Day'n' Nite"". Cudi is soon summoned by Ye to help with the recording of his fourth studio album and one of the most important albums of the decade: *808s and Heartbreaks*. After the tragic and unnecessary death of his mother due to a freak accident that happened during a surgery he helped pay for, coupled with the breaking off of his engagement mere months after this, 808s finds Kanye at his lowest and most emotionally vulnerable state yet. With Kid Cudi providing songwriting on four tracks and being featured on two, Kanye and Cudi would go on to change the landscape of hip hop with *808s and Heartbreaks*, showing not only general audiences but fellow rappers as well that being emotional and ""in your feelings"" is not only cathartic, but commercially viable as well.

The success of *808s and Heartbreaks* and the obvious artistic chemistry between Ye and Cudi led to a long collaborative partnership between the two, with Cudi subsequently appearing on every one of Kanye's solo albums released after 808s and Kanye being featured on multiple Kid Cudi tracks, including ""Erase Me"". 

In September of 2016, 7 months after the release of Kanye's seventh studio album *The Life of Pablo* which once again would feature him on the lead single Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1, Kid Cudi would go on a [twitter rant](http://i.imgur.com/72WXYCu.png) calling out Kanye and Drake by saying that they and other artists didn't care about him unless they want something from him. After hearing this while on the Saint Pablo tour in Tampa, Kanye calls out Cudi over the tweets, telling him to [""Never mention Ye name""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujQimOELtLU) and that he ""birthed"" Cudi. To fans of either artists, these interactions were heartbreaking as the two were viewed as inseparable ever since their first collaboration. During the weeks leading up to the release of his new album, *Passion, Pain, & Demon Slayin'*, it was soon revealed by Kid Cudi on his facebook page that he was checking himself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges, which also explained his erratic behavior on twitter leading up to this moment. After Cudi's eventual release from rehab, him and Kanye would reunite back on stage to perform Father Stretch My Hands together, [ending in a tearful embrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq5IF7AUR0w). That same night, due to the pressures of tour life and fame in general, not to mention the recent mugging of his wife in Paris heavily weighing on him, Kanye would go on a 20 minute, manic rant about radio lying to us (""Radio fuck you""), Kid Cudi being the greatest, how he was putting his life at risk by ranting, asking Jay Z to not send shooters after him, and many other topics. He would end the show early and cancel the remaining 22 dates of the Saint Pablo tour. The next day Kanye would end up hospitalized after appearing at his physicians house and acting so erratic that his physician thought calling the police was necessary, telling 911 he needed help with a ""male with mental illness"". This mental illness would later be revealed by Kanye to be bipolar disorder. 

Almost an entire year would pass by with radio silence from both artists. As the months passed with no word, reports of Kanye recording his new album in the mountains of Wyoming began piling up and with long time collaborator Takashi Murakami -the artist of Graduation's album cover- [posting a picture of himself with Cudi and Ye](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXpojsyF6i9/?taken-by=takashipom), it was apparent that Yeezy season was steadily approaching, and hopefully with a healthier and happier Ye and Cudi. 

Even more time would pass after these reports and still with no official word from either artist about their upcoming projects. That is until Kanye made his return to Twitter and announced the upcoming releases of not one, not two, but FIVE projects, with Kanye executive producing all of them. These five albums would all be 7 tracks long and none would have a runtime of over 30 minutes, with most only reaching the 24 minute threshold. These five albums would include *Daytona* by Pusha T, Kanye's eighth studio album *Ye*, the highly anticipated collaborative album from Kanye West and Kid Cudi *Kids See Ghosts*, Teyanna Taylor's sophomore album *K.T.S.E.*, and Nas' first album in six years *Nasir*.

Taking his own lyric of ""Soon as they like you make em unlike you"" literally, the weeks leading up to the release of Kids See Ghosts would be filled with controversy due to Kanye being 100% back on his bullshit. He would publicly fully endorse President Trump (despite admitting that he knows nothing about politics or Trump's policies), calling him his brother and posting a picture of himself wearing a MAGA hat on twitter, a move that would baffle even the most diehard Ye fans. Literally a week after this, Kanye makes a surprise appearance on TMZ to make his infamous ""slavery was a choice comment"" causing even more backlash. Not even the Yeezy Defense Force could reasonably defend what Kanye was saying and doing around this time, and many Ye fans were just anxiously waiting for the music to drop. 

Finally on June 8th, a week after the release of *Ye*, an album with incredibly introspective and personal lyrics touching on themes of mental health, fatherhood, and fame, Kids See Ghosts' debut album is released. In the huge discography between the two artists, where does KSG rank?

**Review** by u/A_Wavvy_Dude

Clocking in at a mere 24 minutes with only 7 tracks, it is baffling how much of a complete and cohesive project *Kids See Ghosts* sounds like with such little content. Kanye and Cudi bring out the absolute best of each other on this album, and the chemistry between the two is palpable. Kanye (with assistance from Cudi and long time collaborators Dot Da Genius, Mike Dean, and Plain Pat, just to name a few) brought his A game for the production on this album. This album mixes hip hop, jazz, hard rock, and even grunge to create a soundscape that is both very reminiscent of the old ""chop up the beat Kanye"" from the *College Dropout* era yet is also very experimental and new at the same time. Ye also doesn't slack in the bars department, giving us some of his most charismatic, quotable, and socially conscious verses since *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*. Regarding the other half of the duo, Cudi's singing and rapping is so incredibly on point and consistent throughout the entire album. No human should be able to sound *this* on pitch and make it look so easy while simultaneously giving some of his best verses in nearly a decade but Mr. Rager somehow manages to do it all while gifting us with his legendary hums, hums so iconic that Cudi's feature on Travis Scott's *Astroworld* was almost exclusively just him humming. 

You only need to look at the eclectic, bizarre, and psychedelic cover art by Takashi Murakami to see the kind of tonal and sonic direction that *Kids See Ghosts is going for*. This album is an experimental hip hop opus that tackles mental illness and self acceptance in a way no other hip hop album preceding it has done before. Kanye had stated in his almost 2 hour long interview with Charlamagne that he wanted to create music that was therapeutic, and *Kids See Ghosts* is the absolute definition of this. *Kids See Ghosts* sees Kanye and Cudi facing and accepting their respective ""ghosts"" that have been haunting them in the hopes of overcoming their trauma filled pasts. Although their mental illnesses will never fully disappear, they can work towards the goal of not letting their handicaps control them and to continue moving forward as creatives and as people, and I believe the music on this album displays this sentiment beautifully. Also Kanye makes gunshot noises for like 3 minutes.

The album begins with the incredibly energetic and anthemic ""**Feel the Love**"" featuring Pusha T. The track opens with Kid Cudi shouting out from the highest limit of his upper register ""I CAN STILL FEEL THE LOVE"" over a very dreary set of synth chords. It sounds like Cudi climbed the highest mountain peak on earth and is shouting down on us with everything he's got this mantra of staying positive and continuing to feel the love despite past mistakes. This chorus and its constant, echoing repetition throughout the track is instantly infectious and immediately catches the listeners ear. Pusha T then casually saunters onto the track and, with his usual Push bravado, delivers a very short but braggadocious verse about how easy winning is for him and enjoying the excesses of fame. Just as we're getting comfortable and settling into the vibe of the song, Kanye, before Push is even done with his verse, almost as if he's chomping at the bit to start going ballistic, jumps in and starts making these insane gunshot sounds in sync with these cracking snares in the background as the instrumental progresses into a marching rhythm of heavy drum beats. It's ridiculous, it's chaotic, and it is hype as hell. After Kanye's outburst of gunshots the instrumental then breaks down into some downtrodden guitar and bass leads, giving the listener a chance to catch their breath until Kanye reappears to angrily demand ""WHERE THE CHORUS"", a question Cudi happily answers as he breaks back out into the chorus once again. The instrumental then returns to its marching rhythm as Kanye closes the track out by once again making his erratic gunshot sounds. A song that takes *this* many sudden sonic turns should have ended up being an absolute mess, but somehow it manages to sound sharply focused and meticulously crafted. 

The second and shortest track on the album, titled ""**Fire**"", is a prime example of Kanye's eclectic sample choices and how he can craft a beat out of something no one would have ever expected, sampling the marching, tambourine laden beat from a 1966 novelty song called ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"" by the artist Napoleon XIV. Laced over this sample is some very ominous flute work and faintly in the background is what sounds like a distorted, untuned guitar riffing away, all while Cudi's foreboding hums hang around the instrumental. This track is essentially an anti-hater anthem, as Kanye starts his verse off by saying ""I love all your shit talkin"", basically saying that the hate and criticism that he receives just pushes him to become a better artist in the end. To me the most standout thing about Kanye's verse on this track is how absolutely *hungry* he sounds here. He raps with such an overwhelming amount of authority and confidence that makes you hang off of every word he's saying. After, Ye's verse, Cudi follows soon after and does a fantastic job of keeping the energy going and continues the lyrical theme of ignoring the hate that is surrounding him as he tries to overcome the pain from his past. He then plays the song out with a beautiful and forlorn outro in which he reflects on the ""scars he left behind"" and turns to religion to help show him guidance, a recurring topic on the album. If I had to choose one, this is probably my least favorite track on the album and that's most likely attributed to the brevity of the track since it feels like not a lot really happens during the track's short runtime. That being said, this is still a pretty fantastic song that just isn't as fantastic as some of the other tracks on here. 

After this is the appropriately titled third track ""**4th Dimension**"", which sounds like exactly that, something that has come from a foreign and unknown plane of existence, and it is arguably the best track on the project. Once again we have Kanye using an off the wall sample choice for the foundation of the track, taking a vocal sample from a 1936 Christmas song titled ""What Will Santa Claus Say?"" by Louis Prima (credited as a feature on the track) and then just chopping and distorting the absolute shit out of it until we get the Frankenstein beat we see before us that gives the track a very demented and eerie feel to it. Kanye starts the track off with an explicitly raunchy verse about sex in which he relates sex to this new, indescribable dimension and speaks about it as if it's some kind of religious experience (""Now drop to your knees for the offerin""). This verse is absolutely dripping with Kanye's classic charisma and is full of hilarious one liners and witty quotables, especially the last line of his verse where he says if he gets locked up he won't finish the sent... and then the verse just ends. In between Kanye and Cudi's verses there's this really weird witch laughter that plays as the beat cuts off. I've seen a lot of people say that this laughter is awkward and kills the track for them which I think is a somewhat valid complaint but personally I think it adds to the overall eerie and mind bending nature of the track pretty well. Towards the back end of this laughter Kid Cudi hops in to give what is easily my favorite verse on the entire album. Cudi flows on this beat like it's nothing and sounds absolutely *menacing* while he does it, as if he's just begging you to give him a reason. Cudi continues the theme of being lost and losing everything due to the previous state of his mental health but simultaneously brags about creating the wave other artists are on and taking my bitch like he's Ric Flair. It's incredible. The track ends with a wink from Kanye as a sample of the Shirley Ann Lee song ""Someday"" plays and says that you only want two and a half minutes for a record, almost the exact runtime of the song. 

At the halfway point we have the spiritual successor to the track ""Ghost Town"" off of Kanye's previous album *ye* with the song titled ""**Freeee (Ghost Town Pt. 2)**"" featuring Ty Dolla $ign. For me this is where the whole concept of ""therapeutic music"" that Kanye was going for really started to materialize itself. Using a roaring guitar sample from the song ""Stark"" by UK producer Mr. Chop as the main foundation for the instrumental, this track sees Kanye, Cudi, and Ty letting go of all inhibitions and just going absolutely ballistic with their echoing, thunderous proclamations of feeling free being reverberated throughout the entire track. The whole thing sounds like this triumphant victory ballad, as if Kanye and Cudi are celebrating the defeat of their demons and their success in letting go of all earthly ties. The performances on this track are amazing and have such an intense, pulsating energy to them that it's easy to get swept up in the cathartic and rebellious nature of the track, an effect that Kanye seemingly intended with his suggestion of ""You should quit your job to this"". Ty Dolla $ign's feature is probably my favorite of the three features on the album as he delivers these characteristically buttery smooth vocal melodies but still manages to keep up with Kanye and Cudi's wild tendencies. The combination of the hard rock instrumental and the previously mentioned off the wall vocal performances makes this track feel like more of a psychedelic rock n' roll song ripped straight out of the seventies instead of your average hip hop song. Kanye himself also seems to view this song as a pure rock track, as he and Def Jam Records submitted the track for consideration in the Rock category of the 2019 Grammys, for both 'Best Rock Song' and 'Best Rock Performance'. Being a sequel/spiritual successor to Ghost Town, many of the sentiments on that track are mirrored and expounded upon in this one, with Kanye and Cudi further repeating the notion of not feeling pain anymore and transcending the constant criticism that is laid upon them and defying the boundaries set by society. 

Acting as a breather after the bombastic display of triumph that was highlighted on the previous track is the incredibly introspective and deeply personal track ""**Reborn**"", one of only two tracks on the album to not feature a Kanye production credit. This is my personal favorite off of the project and I've noticed that since the release of Kids See Ghosts this is the one track I've been coming back to the most out of all the others. The production on this track (courtesy of Cudi, benny blanco, E*Vax, Plain Pat, and Dot Da Genius) is fantastic, featuring these very playful piano notes mixed in with a lo-fi chalky beat with the whole thing being tied together by Kid Cudi's melancholic humming guiding us throughout the track. There is something so comforting about Cudi's iconic humming that instantly makes a songs atmosphere significantly more relaxing, almost as if his hums are consoling you, telling you it's okay to feel sad and that things are going to get better even though it may not seem like it. If this is what Cudi's hums represent, then nowhere are they more at home than on this track. Thematically the song is about the concept of starting anew and becoming reinvigorated after going through the process of bettering oneself and continuing to evolve as a person, or becoming ""reborn"". Cudi's singing takes center stage on this track and showcases the theme beautifully with the hook repeating that he is reborn and will keep moving forward. In his verse he reflects on the issues in his past that have brought him to this point of rebirth he now finds himself at. He muses about being lost and how having this feeling of not knowing where to go further added to his depression, until eventually realizing that happiness is something that has to come from within. As stated in the lyrics, Cudi has come a long way from past issues that have haunted him; from battling substance abuse and trying to keep custody of his child to depression and anxiety taking control of his thoughts and his life. However, now that he has been reborn he has no more stress and there's no stopping him from continuing to be the best version of himself that he can be. Then we have Kanye, also with an exceptionally introspective verse about the feeling of isolation that comes with fame and being torn between two different mental states, one being a state of manic high octane outbursts and the other being a state of low energy depression due to him being bipolar. Kanye being the public figure that he is, his fractured mental state was put on display for all to see and the results of this was the masses calling Kanye crazy, something he now views as a badge of honor. Kanye goes on to challenge anyone who's listening to continue giving him all the criticism he's been getting because no matter what people throw at him, he'll be able to take it, and he is willing to take all of the hate he receives and attempt to keep moving forward. The track ends with the beat switching up as Cudi takes the perspective of where he was before he was reborn: being lost and not knowing which way to go. However, the answer is right there, telling him to keep moving forward.

Up next is the point where the ""Ghosts"" part of *Kids See Ghosts* shows itself with the haunting title track featuring Yasiin Bey. The production of this track is absolutely hair-raising with a cloudy, speedy chord progression mixed with these very ethereal synth chords and it also has what I wanna say is a xylophone sample as well? Over this ghostly beat Yasiin Bey delivers an incredibly subdued chorus,  repeating this sentiment of kids seeing ghosts sometimes. Tremaine Emory (a friend of Kanye's and an affiliate of G.O.O.D. Music) has given some insight on the meaning of this chorus and the album title as a whole, saying ""Kids can see what adults no longer allow themselves to see"", more or less saying that kids operate at a higher state of creativity and imagination than adults do. Kid Cudi delivers a very lowkey vocal performance with a delayed echoing effect on his vocals that helps add to the overall spooky vibe of the track. He raps about being copied by other artists and once again delves into the status of his mental state, once again bringing up feeling lost and searching for something, although he feels like he's starting to run out of time because he can hear ""angels coming"". Kanye on the other hand gives a show stopping verse that is the exact opposite of lowkey, coming onto the track with a razor sharp focus rapping about religion, being greater than his competition, striving to be the best at whatever he does, and continuing to push the envelop in every way he knows how. This verse is incredibly dense with classic Yeezy quotables coming at a breakneck speed and it has that characteristic Kanye charm to it that his last album just felt like it was lacking a bit. Yasiin Bey closes the track out with a very meditative bridge where he just starts throwing out these philosophical concepts like ""civilization without society"" or ""stability without stasis."" It sounds almost like he has ascended to this plane of higher intelligence and he's attempting to share his knowledge through these brief interpolations. 

Finally we have the closing track ""**Cudi Montage**"" which contains my favorite beat out of the outstanding group of beats on here. With this being the only other song besides Reborn to not contain a Kanye production credit, this track's fantastic instrumental can be attributed to Kid Cudi, Mike Dean, and Dot Da Genius. For me what makes the production on this track so great is the fantastic use of a grimy Kurt Cobain guitar sample that makes up the majority of the instrumental here. It sounds like Cudi has finally perfected the marriage between grunge and hip hop that he was attempting to create on Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven back in 2015. Cudi opens the track with a verse continuing one of the album's themes of looking to God and religion for guidance with him rapping about the world weighing on him and only heaven can help him become stronger. In between Cudi's verse and Kanye's upcoming verse the beat begins to breakdown as the aforementioned guitar sample fades away and these gorgeous synth leads come in for Cudi to start harmonizing over. He shouts out into the cosmos for God to save him and reaffirming that he must stay strong after overcoming his past traumas. After this beautiful choral interlude we are then thrust back into the original beat of the song as Kanye gives one of his most socially conscious verses in years, describing the cycle of violence that comes with having a gang mentality and the far reaching, unforeseen damage it causes. The instrumental once again breaks down with Kanye coming in on the chorus alongside Kid Cudi to give some unexpectedly great singing as he joins Cudi in asking the Lord to help save him, closing out the track and the album with the same brilliant level of quality that we've come to expect from this duo. This is an album that is never one note, always trying something knew and succeeding every time it does. To me, this is album of the year.

,BREAKING: Trump has granted Clemency to rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black,"Tweet: ""Breaking: Trump has granted clemency to rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black and former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (reporting by [@steveholland1](https://twitter.com/steveholland1))""

Steve Holland, a Reuters reporter for the White House, is reporting this information.

**UPDATE: It's official. Lil Wayne has been granted a full pardon from Donald Trump. Kodak Black & Harry O (Co-Founder of Death Row Records) were granted commutations for their prison sentences.**

**Link to Official List of Pardons & Commutations on White House Website:** [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/)

""**Bill K. Kapri –** President Trump granted a commutation to Bill Kapri, more commonly known as Kodak Black. Kodak Black is a prominent artist and community leader. This commutation is supported by numerous religious leaders, including Pastor Darrell Scott and Rabbi Schneur Kaplan. Additional supporters include Bernie Kerik, Hunter Pollack, Gucci Mane, Lil Pump, Lil Yachty, Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens, Jack Brewer formerly of the National Football League, and numerous other notable community leaders. Kodak Black was sentenced to 46 months in prison for making a false statement on a Federal document. He has served nearly half of his sentence. Before his conviction and after reaching success as a recording artist, Kodak Black became deeply involved in numerous philanthropic efforts. In fact, he has committed to supporting a variety of charitable efforts, such as providing educational resources to students and families of fallen law enforcement officers and the underprivileged. In addition to these efforts, he has paid for the notebooks of school children, provided funding and supplies to daycare centers, provided food for the hungry, and annually provides for underprivileged children during Christmas. Most recently while still incarcerated, Kodak Black donated $50,000 to David Portnoy’s Barstool Fund, which provides funds to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kodak Black’s only request was that his donation go toward restaurants in his hometown.""

**""Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. –** President Trump granted a full pardon to Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., also known as “Lil Wayne.”  Mr. Carter pled guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, owing to a conviction over 10 years ago.  Brett Berish of Sovereign Brands, who supports a pardon for Mr. Carter, describes him as “trustworthy, kind-hearted and generous.”  Mr. Carter has exhibited this generosity through commitment to a variety of charities, including donations to research hospitals and a host of foodbanks.  Deion Sanders, who also wrote in support of this pardon, calls Mr. Wayne “a provider for his family, a friend to many, a man of faith, a natural giver to the less fortunate, a waymaker, \[and\] a game changer.""

""**Michael Harris –** President Trump commuted the sentence of Michael Harris. Mr. Harris is a 59-year-old who has served 30 years of a 25 year to life sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Mr. Harris has had an exemplary prison record for three decades. He is a former entrepreneur and has mentored and taught fellow prisoners how to start and run businesses. He has completed courses towards business and journalism degrees. Upon his release, Mr. Harris will have a meaningful place of employment and housing with the support of his family.""

**Update - Kodak Black's Response**: ""I Want To Thank The President 
@RealDonaldTrump
 For His Commitment To Justice Reform And Shortening My Sentence.  I Also Want To Thank Everyone For Their Support And Love.
It Means More Than You Will Ever Know. I Want To Continue Giving Back, Learning And Growing.

axwell1997,Kim Kardashian Files for Divorce from Kanye West,"https://www.tmz.com/2021/02/19/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-file-for-divorce/

* Kim Kardashian has filed to divorce Kanye West after 7 years of marriage, but our sources say it's as amicable as a divorce can be.

* Kim is asking for joint legal and physical custody of the couple's 4 kids. Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ Kanye is fine with the joint custody arrangement, and we're told both Kim and Ye are committed to co-parenting together.

* There's a prenup and we're told neither party is contesting it. In fact, our sources say they are already far along in reaching a property settlement agreement.

* The docs, filed by disso queen Laura Wasser, don't list a date of separation ... it's listed as to be determined. The date is almost irrelevant, because their split has been so well-chronicled in the news and social media.

* It was during the last half of 2020 when things got super rocky for Kimye ... West launched his Presidential campaign on July 4 and weeks later held a bizarre campaign event in South Carolina. At one point, a sobbing Kanye told a story of a discussion he had with Kim ... talking about abortion when she was pregnant with their first child.

* It wasn't long after that when Kanye took a series of shots at the Kardashian/Jenner family on Twitter, at one point referring to matriarch, Kris Jenner, as ""Kris Jong Un.""

* Multiple sources with direct knowledge told us Kim was ready to call it quits after Kanye's outbursts, if not for Kanye going through a serious bipolar episode. She had felt it would be cruel to end the marriage when he wasn't doing well.

* Things got so rocky, the couple had been living separately for a few months. He was spending a lot of his time in Wyoming while she was in Calabasas with the kids. The issue? We were told it wasn't contentious or ugly ... but their differences in lifestyle and politics were chief, among others.",1613766550.0,,1150,/r/hiphopheads/comments/lnporc/kim_kardashian_files_for_divorce_from_kanye_west/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/lnporc/kim_kardashian_files_for_divorce_from_kanye_west/,8881,0.97

InTooDeep024,[SHOTS FIRED] Iggy Azalea exposes Playboi Carti for allegedly being a negligent father upon the release of Whole Lotta Red,"For those who aren’t aware, Iggy Azalea and Playboi Carti were in a serious relationship and recently had a son together. However, shortly after their son was born, the couple tragically parted ways and there’s been some lingering tension between the two. 

There were rumors of infidelity based on ambiguous Instagram Stories from Iggy, but it seems like Iggy wanted to bring everything to light right as *Whole Lotta Red* was set to drop. She tweeted the following:

[Too bad you got an album out but can’t even come to Christmas with your own son.](https://twitter.com/iggyazalea/status/1342337960440524800?s=21)

TheHHHRobot,Remembering /u/aacarbone,"Hey everyone. We've got to break some sad news.

About 8 weeks ago, longtime /r/hiphopheads user and moderator /u/aacarbone passed away. aacarbone, or Andrew as those who had the chance to talk to and get to know him outside of Reddit knew him, was a big part of this community over the last several years. He was opinionated, funny, and irreverent—but with a really good heart and a penchant for being on top of social issues. Undeniably memorable to everyone who got a chance to interact with him. He loved putting other people onto music (especially 2000s rap, and *especially* Cam'ron). His last comment before he passed was shitting on Drake, and with his sense of humor we'd like to think he'd be pretty pleased about that. No one here could forget some of the funnier moments he was involved in, whether it was [getting ignored by Cam'ron in his AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/4k3hcy/i_am_killa_camronama/d3bteu5/?context=3), [offering fashion tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/5f74nx/sunday_general_discussion_november_27th_2016/dahy9bd/?context=3), [stanning over Purple Haze](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/3ax24a/essential_album_of_the_week_69_camron_purple_haze/csgrdfe/), or [keeping warm-fuzzy feel-good comments about the HHH community in check](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/73u5kh/daily_discussion_thread_10022017/dnt4w76/?context=1).

His passing is a tragic loss, but the modteam thought this thread could be a way to remember and share some of the fun moments and stories members of the /r/hiphopheads community got to share with aacarbone over the last several years. And bump some Dipset songs in his memory, of course.

His mother shared the cause of his death with us in a message—and as aacarbone was always willing to be open about his struggles with sobriety in our Sunday General Discussions and talk to others who faced similar struggles in our little community (as well as sharing his goals and dreams and life updates with us), we felt it was alright for us to share it with the rest of you.

>I think it's nice to have the people who appreciated him know what happened and have the opportunity to say something. I suspect there's some speculation as to the cause of his death and I will tell ya'll that it was due to cocaine laced with fentanyl. He had no idea it was laced and had even googled ""what does heroin look like"" so he knew something wasn't right but didn't know what it was. He obviously didn't know it would kill him. I'm telling ya'll this because I had never heard of this but apparently it's becoming more common for drug dealers to mix fentanyl with other drugs- possibly even unintentionally from residue left on the scale or something like that. Pretty scary stuff- just a little bit can kill someone.

>In the obituary it does list a charity that people could donate to. It's a good charity that our expanded family started many years ago for children with serious illnesses. The people who run it do it as a passion project so there's little fees involved, leaving about 95% of donations to go directly to people who need the money. We set up a fund in his name for people who struggle with sobriety for any reason- and hopefully that will be used to help some young people who have no other resources or hope.

[His obituary is here](http://www.courant.com/obituaries/hc-obituary-andrew-riley-carbone-20180414-story.html), and if anyone wishes to do so, a link to the charity to send donations to in Andrew's name is included.

>Andrew lived a short life, but he knew so much. With his wonderful grin always at the ready, he knew how to laugh and make others laugh. With his big heart, he knew how to give love and unstinting loyalty to friends and family. With his strength, he know how to work physically demanding jobs with both strange (4 - 9 AM) and long hours (restaurants!). For all Andrew knew, there were also things he pretended he didn't know: how to make a bed or use a hamper, how to wash his car. He'd go weeks without bothering to deposit his pay. If you borrowed his car, you'd find his tip cash spilling out of his glove box and crumpled paychecks wedged amongst his CD's. He knew how to persist. In high school, he joined the football team. He went to every practice and practiced hard. He loved the sport, but despite the practice and training, he didn't get a lot of playing time. But he never quit. And so when he finally got into a game and scored a touchdown, his smile that day broke a record for joy. Andrew would always work hard. And he could play hard. Unfortunately for Andrew, playing hard lead to a struggle to stay sober. He faced that struggle head on. He went to treatment, he fought for sobriety. He knew that he had much to look forward to; he was building a great and generous life. But he lost his fight on April 7, 2018 at the age of 23. And so we lost a man whom we loved, a man who knew so much about making the world better for all those blessed to know him.

aaliyaahson,"Drake Opens Up About the Entire Kanye/Pusha T Beef on Lebron's ""The Shop""","\-Says Kanye texted him about coming to Wyoming

\-40 goes to Wyoming 1 day earlier than Drake and tells Drake that somethings “off”

\-Drake goes anyways and is told Ye wants to help Drake with music

\-Drake claims all his time in Wyoming was spent on helping Kanye

\-Drake says Ye asked for his release date for Scorpion and told Drake not to worry because he planned on dropping in November. Drake then woke up one morning to find that Kanye announced release dates for his albums based around Scorpion's June 15th release date (Which probably forced Drake to push Scorpion back 2 weeks.)

\-Drake says he played March 14th for Ye in Wyoming and showed him a picture of his son, and asked advice on how to handle the situation

\-Drake says Kanye played him Lift Yourself and gave him the beat. He left Wyoming with Lift Yourself and thinking everything was buddy buddy with him and Kanye

\-Kanye passively texts Drake  “I love you bro” and drops Lift Yourself himself with a bunch of scoops and Drake realizes Ye was trolling him and being manipulative the whole time and Drake started to distance himself

\- Says he was confused when Daytona dropped with ghostwriting disses against him and that Kanye helped produce it considering that he was just with them in Wyoming writing for them and helping them create music as friends

\-Says that only part of TSOA that was off limits was the 40 diss

\-He says the diss track he was creating was very bad and he was saying terrible things on it and didn't want to be remembered for that. He texted LeBron about ultimately not putting it out

\- He says he thought TSOA was trash but a genius chess move and that Push is gonna get whats coming to him eventually

\- Says he can live with ""rap purists"" thinking he has a ""chink in his armor"" for not responding. Says he'd much rather that then the lengths he was gonna go to on a diss against both Pusha and Kanye.

\- Says he made Nonstop, In My Feelings, Mob Ties and a bunch of other songs after the beef.

GetGowenz,"My brother got pulled up on stage by Kendrick Lamar two months ago, it went into a speech about depression and has impacted my brother greatly (xpost happy)","About 2 months ago my brother went to a 4 day music festival. His main goal was to be front row for his favorite musical artist Kendrick Lamar.

A little about my brother. We grew up in a good family.l We had trouble in school. My brother and me were bullied. I was more open with my emotions. He was not. He hid his true emotions because he felt like admitting he was depressed was giving up. 

He went to the festival to see Kendrick. It turned crazy. When Kendrick performed the depression ballad 'U' he noticed my brother in the front row singing every word along with him. In the middle of his song he just stopped and demanded he joined him on stage.

2 days prior to this concert my brother had submitted an 1000 word essay for his college english class about this song. It was crazy.

Logan had no clue what to do and thought that he was asking for someone else. A few friends he made at the concert helped push him over the barrier. He got on stage and Kendrick broke into a speech about how depression is real. And how he may not understand what my brother is going through, but that he doesn't have to. He said people like my brother are why he makes songs. 

He had the crowd chant my brothers name. Then he allowed my brother to dance with him on stage while 30,000 people watched and cheered him on. He got to watch the rest of the concert from the side of the stage and walk with his IDOL to his car before he left.

I woke up the next morning seeing it all over twitter. I saw videos and all these crazy things. When he got off of the stage and was walking to his campsite he was stopped by over 100 people saying how awesome that was.

My brother can say what he wants but I know the true pain and stuff he's went through. 

Since the concert and this everythings changed. He is serious about losing his weight. He found a great girlfriend. He's taking school seriously. This has 100 percent been for the best of my brother and I'm so thankful he got the chance to join his idol on stage.

Here's the full video of the song live and him bringing my brother on stage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaUC0GupnLQ",1463328993.0,,454,/r/hiphopheads/comments/4jgr23/my_brother_got_pulled_up_on_stage_by_kendrick/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/4jgr23/my_brother_got_pulled_up_on_stage_by_kendrick/,8447,0.98

&#x200B;

Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti was arrested on drug and gun charges Thursday after deputies stopped his Lamborghini in Clayton County, authorities said.

The rapper, whose real name is Jordan Carter, was initially stopped for an expired tag, Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill said Friday in a news release.

Inside the car, deputies discovered 12 bags of marijuana, three guns, xanax, codeine and oxycodone, authorities said.

Carter and another man, Jaylon Tucker, were both arrested and taken to the Clayton County jail.

Carter is the boyfriend of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. In November, the couple had $350,000 worth of jewelry stolen after someone broke into their Buckhead home, AJC.com previously reported.

The culmination of self-imposed exile in Hawaii months after the [infamous VMA incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z8gCZ7zpsQ&ab_channel=ArtisanNewsService), Kanye enlisted the help of a star-studded ""Rap Camp"" including the likes of Jay-Z, Beyonce, RZA, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Pusha T, Kid Cudi, among others. A [Complex article](https://www.complex.com/music/kanye-west-interview-2010-cover-story#:~:text=That's%20right%2C%20from%20the%20studio,boards%2024%20hours%20a%20day.) detailing the creation process can be found here.

This album was preceded by ""G.O.O.D. Fridays"" with songs from these studio sessions dropping every week in anticipation of the project's drop. He then dropped a 35 minute film [""Runaway""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg5wkZ-dJXA&ab_channel=KanyeWestVEVO) to accompany the album which included most songs off the project. It quickly debuted atop the Billboard 200 the following week and floored critics [receiving rave reviews](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/score/metascore/year/filtered?year_selected=2010&distribution=&sort=desc&view=detailed) for what can be argued as his magnum opus. It went on to receive the Grammy for Best Rap Album in 2012. 

10 years later, there's a lot to be said about what this album did for Kanye and where it sits in his career.

Hayday12designacct,French Montana Caught Using Fake Streams With Hacked Spotify Accounts," ""Writing on the Wall"" w/ Cardi & Post flopped on arrival in 2019, and now its suddenly gaining and heading for top 20 on Spotify. 

Twitter Thread:

> french montana's out here buying streams in a desperate attempt to turn his 3 months old flop song into a hit 

 [https://i.imgur.com/IHOxFEo.png](https://i.imgur.com/IHOxFEo.png) 

&#x200B;

> the song was released on sept 27, 2019 and it wasn't very successful despite having two popular rappers featured on it. it charted for 5 weeks & left the top 200 on spotify, then re-entered 3 weeks later & even reached a new peak on spotify US today & this is where it gets weird

&#x200B;

> apparently the reason why it's charting again is because it's currently popular on tiktok...then why is it only rising on spotify? i mean when you look at the pics the difference between spotify and apple music is astounding.  #21 (+27) on spotify #1192 (-105) on apple music???

 [https://i.imgur.com/k4MahFs.png](https://i.imgur.com/k4MahFs.png) 

&#x200B;

> so i decided to search on twitter to see if anyone was actually listening to the song since its popular on tiktok and i found some very interesting tweets of people saying their spotify was hacked and it was playing...french montana. 

 [https://i.imgur.com/TvaqpAg.png](https://i.imgur.com/TvaqpAg.png) 

&#x200B;

> look carefully at the dates most of those tweets were sent, between 18-25 december 2019. now look at the date ""writing on the wall"" re-entered spotify US. december 22. y'all see where i'm going with this?

 [https://i.imgur.com/3D3yfvp.png](https://i.imgur.com/3D3yfvp.png) 

&#x200B;

> in conclusion its really easy to get a hit song nowadays, all you need is a fraudulent label who's willing to spend money on you. so if you see writing on the wall by french montana in the top 10 on billboard next month don't forget to come back to this thread. that's all for now 

 [https://i.imgur.com/Ew9Rfby.png](https://i.imgur.com/Ew9Rfby.png)

Rick Rubin, Kim and other industry people were listening to Kanye's phone call. There's video proof of the phone call because Kanye records all his calls. (Full Quotes Inside)","Article: http://www.gq.com/story/kim-kardashian-west-gq-cover-story


> Kim says Taylor's deep emotional wound is nonsense—okay, she says it's a lie—and that there's video proof, because a videographer was actually filming their phone call. Why? Because Kim's husband commissions videographers to film everything when he's recording an album, for posterity (and possibly, one day, a documentary). And this is where it gets sticky.

>**""She totally approved that,"" Kim says, shaking her head in annoyance. ""She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't. I swear, my husband gets so much shit for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.""** Kim is on a roll now, speaking faster and more animatedly than at any other point during our time together. **""What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?""**

>Swift, Kim insists,** ""totally gave the okay. **Rick Rubin was there. So many respected people in the music business heard that [conversation] and knew**. I mean, he's called me a bitch in his songs. That's just, like, what they say. I never once think, [gasping] 'What a derogatory word! How dare he?'Not in a million years.**

>**I don't know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden.… It was funny because [on the call with Kanye, Taylor] said, 'When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I'm so against this, and I'll just laugh and say, 'The joke's on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.' And I'm like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.""**

>Were they in touch after that?

>“No. Maybe **an attorney's letter she sent saying, ‘Don't ever let that footage come out of me saying that. Destroy it.’ ”**

>[Taylor] sent one?

>“Yeah. **They sent an attorney's letter like, ‘Don't you dare do anything with that footage,’ and asking us to destroy it.” She pauses. “When you shoot something, you don't stop every two seconds and be like, ‘Oh wait, we're shooting this for my documentary.’ You just film everything, and whatever makes the edit, then you see, then you send out releases. It's like what we do for our show.”**

e: Poor Ye. He really is surrounded by the fucking Wolves. 

e2: [lol, snek indeed.](http://i.imgur.com/r3Chm04.jpg)

e3: New Developments

* Taylor Swift's attorneys have sent a letter to the Kardashians threatening legal action if they release the footage. 

* California's a 2 party consent state meaning it's illegal to record someone on a call without their permission. These laws not only expose you to the risk of criminal prosecution, but also potentially give an injured party a civil claim for money damages against you.


* So if the recording gets leaked/released without Taylor's permission Kanye can face criminal charges by the state and Taylor can personally sue him which she has already threatened to do.

* If Taylor has nothing to hide, she would give consent to release the tape. She's obviously trying to hide the truth and California law lets her. 

* Taylor also had a very staged paparazzi shoot pretending to date Loki yesterday that dominated all the tabloids. Working theory is that her team is trying to divert all press attention away from the Kim K story.

Chriscftb97,Things that rappers are hotter than (part. 2),"7 years ago /u/UkranianLimbs posted [a list of some things that rappers said they were hotter than.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/178inp/what_rappers_are_hotter_than_oc/)

I figured we're due for another, so I spent a bit of time combing through Genius for some examples.

""I'm hotter than"" is one of the most cliche things in hip-hop, but sometimes rappers can get creative with it.

So without further ado, let's see what rappers are hotter than.

[Here's his feed](https://twitter.com/kanyewest), if someone wants to take the important tweets/make an imgur album and format them for reddit, pls...

This thread is about Kanye, if you want to complain about moderation, feel free to do so in the Daily Discussion thread, but you're drowning out the Kanye discussion doing it in this thread.

Here are the threads that this is replacing:

- [Kanye West is currently tweeting out every page of his official Def Jam contract.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/itz8xe/kanye_west_is_currently_tweeting_out_every_page/)

- [Kanye peeing on a Grammy](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/itzvua/kanye_peeing_on_a_grammy/)


This is in reverse chronological order and is abridged:

>90% of the record contracts on the planet are still on a royalty A standard record deal is a trap to NEVER have you recoup, and there’s all these hidden costs like the “distribution fees” many labels put in their contracts to make even more money off our work without even trying.

Other's have come out in support of Kanye taking on the labels, including Hit-Boy and Kenny Beats ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/iu0dar/hitboy_says_kanye_stopped_picking_my_beats/)).

[Hit-Boy posted this on Instagram:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFM9QrgHSad/?utm_source=ig_embed)

>I haven’t been a fan of Kanye on a personal/ human level since he told me face to face he stopped picking my beats because I worked with Beyoncé. this is after I produced niggas in paris , clique, and a myriad of other songs / projects for him and his label GOOD Music in the 2 years I was signed with them. This tweet is something I can agree with though. @umpg has held me in what the last 3 lawyers Ive hired have referred to as the “worst publishing contact they’ve ever seen” since I was 19 years old. Im 33 now and have multiple Grammys, produced a lot of your favorite artists biggest songs on top of turning in over 450+ records since I first signed and @umpg still doesnt have it in them to simply be fair. If they’re doing this to me with all I’ve accomplished through hard work I can only imagine the kids who don’t have big placements/ proper guidance. If I have to be the one to get blackballed for telling the truth and trying to set the next generation free then so be it. Btw I produced 10+ joints on the CURRENT number one album in the country D2. @umpg @polowdadon @jodyagerson @iamwalterjones and the company who’s helping me on the management side @rocnation let’s fix this. Slave deals are still very real /rampant in 2020. @universalmusicgroup

**Album Background**

I was 16 when I first heard about Mac Miller.  Walking down the hallway in between classes at my old high school, I noticed a pile of flyers laying on the floor promoting a gig for someone who was, at that place and time, just a local rapper one year older than myself, trying to make it big in a city that was, up until Wiz’s ascent, not known for rappers or hip hop music of any sort.  I couldn’t have predicted that the kid I saw on the ad, performing in a small venue that likely didn’t seat more than a couple hundred people, would have the first independently released Billboard #1 in nearly two decades by the end of the following year.  I couldn’t have predicted that he would be making music with some of the biggest names in the industry not long after that.  I couldn’t have predicted that I would meet Mr. Miller myself on a couple occasions and, especially considering his earlier material pre-*Watching Movies with the Sound Off* hadn’t wowed me, that his later music would someday resonate with me in a way that not too many other artists’ music would.

&nbsp;

I also couldn’t have predicted that eight years later I would be legitimately shaken by his passing, more so than any other musician or public figure who had left this Earth earlier than expected in my lifetime.

&nbsp;

The tumultuous final months of Mac’s life were well-documented, as his break-up with Ariana Grande and subsequent drunk driving incident came within a week of one another in mid-May.  It was at this point that I, along with plenty of others, became genuinely concerned for where Mac’s headspace was at.  The drunken joyride was only part of the problem, as Grande confirmed that Mac’s inability to remain sober was what ultimately led to their estrangement.  Her short-lived engagement to SNL star Pete Davidson one month after couldn’t have made matters any better.  With the walls of Mac’s life seemingly crashing down around him, it only seemed inevitable that his next project would be used to address these controversies.

&nbsp;

Mac released three singles at the end of May following his car crash, only one of which made the album (a shame in a way, as I’d really enjoyed “Programs” and “Buttons” and feel the record would have benefitted from their inclusion, either in addition to the songs included on the final project or as replacements for one or two of the album cuts).  The album was officially announced in mid-July alongside the music video for lead single “Self Care”, and officially dropped on a jam-packed August 3rd which coincided with the releases of Travis’s *Astroworld*, YG’s *Stay Dangerous* and of course, the project that would end up overshadowing them all, Iggy Azalea’s EP that I can’t remember the name of.  As a result, *Swimming* may not have gotten the initial shine it deserved, but this was unfortunately rectified with Mac’s passing five weeks after its release, which propelled the album back onto the charts and prompted “Self Care” to become his first top 40 single.

&nbsp;

*Swimming* was crafted with a lineup of all-star producers and collaborators, including the likes of J. Cole, Snoop Dogg, Flying Lotus, Thundercat, John Mayer, DJ Dahi, Cardo, Dâm-Funk, Steve Lacy from the Internet and Dev Hynes of Blood Orange, just to name a few.  Mac’s producer pseudonym Larry Fisherman is also credited on several cuts, and film composer Jon Brion (most famous in Mac’s chosen genre for providing additional instrumentation on Kanye’s *Late Registration* and Frank Ocean’s *Blonde*) was brought in at the last minute to flesh out the production.  The album goes in many different directions and almost works as a summary of all the different styles of music Mac had approached making over the years - perhaps fitting for what would end up being his final piece of work.

&nbsp;

________________________________________
**Review**

Mac starts the proceedings with “Come Back to Earth”, a gorgeous guitar and keyboard-laden ballad which perfectly encapsulates a lot of the themes that permeate the rest of the music to follow: past regrets, social alienation and a pervasive sense of depression.  Mac’s singing chops aren’t always perfect on this album but on this cut in particular they’re wonderful: there’s a dual sense of melancholy but also hope that comes across in his performance, and while the track serves as not much more than an introduction (Mac’s performance lasts just over 2 minutes) it’s so powerful that I wound up enjoying this song perhaps more than anything else on the record.  This isn’t a slight against the rest of the album, though; more so it’s a testament to how impactful Mac’s message comes through along with his vocal, particularly the lyric “I’ll do anything for a way out of my head”, which, along with the rest of the album at large, has taken on a whole new significance now knowing he was doomed to find the way out sooner than he or anyone else expected.  

&nbsp;

Contrasting with the calmness of “Come Back to Earth”, “Hurt Feelings” picks the energy up with a brooding trap instrumental produced by Hollywood Cole himself, with Dev Hynes and Jon Brion contributing to the beat as well. Mac’s lyrics are equally celebratory and disturbing here: he alludes to the various worldly pleasures his success has brought him, referencing new cribs with blue fountains and his infamous jacuzzi video, but at the same time recognizes that his success hasn’t actually helped to solve his problems; in turn, it’s merely exacerbated them.  This is a pretty solid kick off to the record and helps to pick up the pace vibe-wise after “Come Back to Earth”.

&nbsp;

The album’s second single “What’s the Use?” comes next, an upbeat funk number for Mac to vibe over courtesy of Pomo and Dâm-Funk that falls in line stylistically with what Mac was doing on his previous album *The Divine Feminine*.  The production on the track is the easy highlight: it’s infectious and will get stuck in your head for days, with an indelible bass line and backing vocals from Snoop, Thundercat and Syd from the Internet helping to flesh everything out.  The musical high point for me has to be the synth cacophony complementing a soaring vocal that interrupts the proceedings in the middle of the track before launching back into the chorus.  Unfortunately, though, there is one semi-glaring flaw here that I cannot get past completely, and that’s Mac’s singing.  The chorus on “What’s the Use?” serves as the most obvious example on the record where his singing voice just doesn’t connect with me.  His raspy vocal doesn’t compliment the smoothness of the instrumental very well and, considering the hook is a major element of the track, does bring the song down a degree for me as a result.

&nbsp;

Things pick back up again in a major way on “Perfecto”, a song which finds Mac torn between his hedonistic tendencies and the true sources of happiness in his life (primarily Grande) that are trying to save him from drowning in the former.  My own interpretation of this song is that it finds Mac in between his breakup with Ariana and the eventual release of the album, as he references being “on album time” and presumably holing up in the studio (“I gotta get out to shine”).  He seems on the verge of regressing to the drugged-out lows of his yesterdays, referencing it “feeling like a weekend on a Tuesday” and making excuses to dip out on prior commitments to drink with his friends.  At the same time, he keeps up the appearance of being in a good place mentally (“On the surface I look so fine, but really I’m buggin’”) even while he’s treading water and unphased by the potential for him to drown.  Tee-WaTT's instrumental is smooth as silk and fits the vibe of Mac’s delivery and lyrics like a glove.  For me, though, the best part is Jon Brion’s orchestral outro, where Mac delivers a few lines spoken-word style about Ariana and peters out with one last “perfect”.  This song succeeds at pretty much everything it does.

&nbsp;

Following is the aforementioned “Self Care”, the most engaging track on the record and an easy highlight.  The near 6 minute epic is divided into two halves.  The first half has a much darker, more sadistic vibe to it, yet it manages to be catchy as hell at the same time (it’s easy to see why this ended up being the big single off the project).  I’d always taken Mac’s allusion to “self care” in the first half to refer to him self-medicating through drugs and alcohol as opposed to seeking professional help for his issues, and something tells me that “the medicine … on call” that he refers to in the first verse probably wasn’t prescribed by a doctor.  Mac’s paranoia is evident through this part of the song, with allusions to losing his mind and not being able to trust anybody (himself included).  The most relevant line has to be the one about Mac speeding in his Mercedes, but ironically enough, “Self Care” was actually written *prior* to his infamous car accident in an eerie instance of art imitating life.  All of this builds up into the grandiose second half, which features an *excellent* beat switch and a rejuvenated Mac reflecting on where he is in his life and how he’s been handling his substance abuse.  I’d initially suspected this part of the song had him recognizing the faults of his actions because of one line I’d apparently misheard: “I was doing too much, got stuck in oblivion”.  However, every lyric site I’ve checked has it written as “I was **thinking** too much”, which has me wondering if Mac is instead embracing his use in the end and not letting the thoughts surrounding it bother him any longer.  This is substantiated through further references to the oblivion being “a beautiful feeling” and the unfortunate assertion of having “all the time in the world” (it even hurts just having to type that out knowing what we now know in hindsight…)  All that said, this song just straight up *rocks*.

&nbsp;

“Self Care” leads right into “Wings”, which, in contrast to “Self Care”, has a decidedly calmer tone to it.  Alexander Spit’s instrumental feels pretty odd for a hip hop song: slow and fairly minimal, but it has a lot of different sounds and other effects popping up and exiting as Mac does his thing over top of it.  Mac covers a lot of different topics lyrically on here, but all in all feels like he’s in a better place than some of the other tracks on here, saying he “ain’t feelin’ broken no more” and that he “never felt so damn good where he’s at” (this might have had something to do with him recording the song in Hawaii – he even references the sun shining during the pre-chorus).  Not all is cheery in the second verse, though, where Mac acknowledges that he “doesn’t know how the normal shit go” with life given his celebrity status.  Mac’s singing up until the “These are my wings” refrain is pretty on point, but I’ve never really cared for the hook, honestly (though it isn’t as damning as “What’s the Use”, for what it’s worth).  All in all, this is a pretty smooth cut, though I wouldn’t consider it a highlight personally.

&nbsp;

“Ladders” picks the tone back up nicely and is a much better go at the funk sound Mac tried out on “What’s the Use”.  Pomo and Jon Brion lace this thing with an infectious groove, some seriously funky synth work and an awesome horn section following Mac’s hook.  Mac sounds like he’s having a blast here: the chorus (one of the best on the record) insinuates he’s likely in the middle of a night out (and probably high) and wants to make the most of this moment.  While the song’s got a primarily positive tone to it, like most of the more upbeat tracks on the album, there’s still something sinister lurking underneath, with Mac referencing how he “just might slip into the sea”, continuing with the swimming theme of the record.  Still though, this sits firmly as the best party number on the record, and it’s not surprising to see why this wound up being one of the most popular songs off the album.

&nbsp;

The introspective “Small Worlds” comes next and seems to represent the hangover after the high of “Ladders”.  The two songs seem connected, as one line on “Ladders” had Mac saying that “it’s a very small world, we don’t fuck with the size”, while another mentioned “turning the hotel to a castle” (a possible reference to cocaine).  On “Small Worlds”, the world is no longer small to Mac, as he’s left alone to ruminate on his feelings in the five star hotel.  The musical backing on the song, courtesy of Tae Beast and Carter Lang with John Mayer providing some additional guitar work, has a stoned and hazy feel to it, which is *exactly* my type of production style, so this was a real treat (and also sample free, which is surprising – the vintage feel of the instrumental had me swearing he must’ve looped it from somewhere).  It’s almost reminiscent of something Mac would have rapped over on one of his druggier mixtapes back in the day.  Mac’s flow on this joint isn’t anything flashy but it’s *just* right for this beat: ambivalent and a bit lackadaisical, but also perfectly fitting for the lyrical content.  For as great as the actual song is, though, the most moving moment is probably the outro, where Mac’s flow takes a more serious turn as he references “feeling his fingers slippin’” and anticipating his demise while dwelling on how fame isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.  I really can’t praise this song enough.  

&nbsp;

“Conversation Pt. 1” sees Mac talking to someone who lives a “basic” life, spending all their time getting faded and wasting whatever money they manage to come across.  It’s hard to tell whether Mac is speaking to the listener, to himself, or someone else.  I did find it interesting that he says, “My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement”, which is the exact opposite of a line he’d delivered on “Perfecto” (“My feet on the clouds, head on the ground”).  It make sense, as on “Perfecto” Mac seemed more on the fence (or possibly in denial) about where his life was at at the moment, but on “Conversation Pt. 1” he feels supremely confident in himself (whether or not that’s the result of whatever got his ‘head up in the clouds’ is up to interpretation).  Cardo and Yung Exclusive’s work behind the boards here is decent, if not a bit forgettable (which came as a surprise to me as Cardo is one of my favorite producers).  Flying Lotus also has a production credit – I’m guessing he helped with the muted horn parts at the end.  This wasn’t bad but didn’t really feel all that exciting for me.

&nbsp;

Mac delivers the most obviously Grande-inspired cut on the album next with “Dunno”.  While this song was never explicitly confirmed to be about her, a few of the lyrics do seem to reference songs of hers (most notably the last line of the song, “That’s really your favorite, I know”, which supposedly references Mac & Ariana’s 2016 collaboration “My Favorite Part”).  Grande also shared a screenshot of her listening to “Dunno” after Mac’s death on her Instagram story, which seemingly confirms it to be true.  Admittedly, this song was never really a favorite of mine on here, as Parson Brown’s production work feels a bit stale and Mac’s singing is rough at times, but as a peek into Mac’s psyche as he reminisces on the good times he’d had with his girl, it’s pretty touching.

&nbsp;

“Jet Fuel” follows with a laid back beat courtesy of DJ Dahi and Steve Lacy that Mac is able to ride and talk his shit on.  The hook brings back a common theme from throughout the record of being up in the clouds, with Mac stating that he’ll only come down after running out of jet fuel before quipping, “But I never run out of jet fuel”.  I took this to be a commentary on the endless supply of drugs someone like Mac can afford, being rich as fuck and all.  There’s another reference to swimming and drowning at the start of the track as well, with Mac stating “his head’s underwater but he ain’t in the shower and he ain’t gettin’ baptized”.  Outside of these two lamentations, the track mostly consists of brags ‘n’ bullshit, with Mac flowing over the beat pretty effortlessly.  This one didn’t really wow me until the last minute, where the instrumentation drops out in favor of a single warbling synth line and a vocoder-aided vocal performance from Mac that honestly sounds like *nothing* I’ve ever heard him do before.  It’s a great display of his artistic side and showcases a style I wouldn’t have minded seeing him explore in the future.

&nbsp;

Up to this point, the album felt like it had been starting to take a dip in quality in the 2nd half, but fortunately Mac saved two of the best songs he had for very last.  “2009” sports a *beautiful* string-laden intro courtesy of Mr. Brion before transitioning into a mid-paced Eric G production built on a delicate piano loop.  Mac uses the nostalgic sounding instrumental to reflect on where life has taken him over the past decade, stating that “It ain’t 2009 no more”, referring to the last year he had before he really started to blow up (ironically enough, it was 2010 when I first discovered Mac in the hallway of my high school).  Mac doesn’t seem completely content with this passage of time on “2009”, but the song is ultimately an optimistic one, with Mac stating, “I don’t have it all but that’s alright with me”, though a few lines later he does ponder how his life might have been different had he “taken a simpler route”.  In spite of the mistakes he’s made, Mac seems at peace with himself here.  A really beautiful song all around, and one that’s highly relatable for me personally as, like Mac, it really does blow my mind to think 2009 was almost 10 years ago now…

&nbsp;

…which brings us to “So It Goes”, the last song Mac Miller would ever officially release.  It seems fitting that it would be a Larry Fisherman production.  Mac’s instrumental starts with a sole guitar strumming and tapping for percussion as he dwells on his ascendency to fame (“You could have the world in the palm of your hands, you still might drop it”), harkening back to simpler times as he had on “2009” (“There was nothin’ in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin’”), and delivering some premonitions that are especially disturbing in hindsight (“Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven, I'm still gettin' high”).  The instrumental continues to build on itself as the track progresses, until the last two minutes, where Mac breaks into the final chorus and Jon Brion returns with a *huge* swell of synthesizers that play Mac out in the most wonderful way possible.  In a sad twist, [Mac’s final tweet before his death] (https://images.genius.com/6d3940b0f0921f65dd031c9cb6bc54cd.563x1000x1.jpg) expressed his appreciation for the way the song’s outro was executed.  In the end, the man’s final publicized thought was concerned with the final part of his final song.  And just like that, *Swimming* comes to a close.

&nbsp;

________________________________________
I wrote the Album Background section of this review shortly after Mac’s passing when I was still in a complete state of shock over him not being around anymore and in a pretty emotional state (which is usually rare for me).  I was playing the album a *lot* at the time and reflecting on just how much context can come into play in music.  First hearing this record at the beginning of August, it felt like a proper transition point for Mac: sure, the drug references were abound and plentiful, but the album had just as many moments of clarity, and it really did feel like Mac *had* gotten to the point of being able to swim against the tide of his life.  Only a month later did we come to learn this wasn’t to be the case, though.  Now, the album stands as a memorial for one of hip hop’s most tragic stories, not unlike the memorial at Blue Slide Park that I’ve stood in front of in disbelief, reading through notes and letters from fans and old friends and just appreciating how much of an impact the man had left on the world in the incredibly short span of time that he was here.

&nbsp;


*Swimming* isn’t a perfect album.  I wouldn’t even peg it as the man's best album (though it’d probably end up in my top 3 Mac projects at the end of the day).  But as an insight into the final months of one of the biggest voices in this decade of hip hop, it’s a pretty compelling piece of work.  In spite of Mac’s death, this record is just so full of life that when you put it on, it almost helps you forget that he’s gone for a little while.  It isn’t his sharpest lyrically or his most consistent production-wise, but the *feel* of this record is what keeps me coming back to it more than maybe any other Mac project has.  You can tell from the interviews and live performances surrounding this record that Mac was really satisfied with what he’d been able to pull off here.  It makes the circumstances surrounding the album all that much harder to bear, but at the same time, it all comes back to the overarching theme: Mac Miller was drowning on Earth, but now he’s swimming somewhere else, and even if it’s wishful thinking on my part, I’d like to think that wherever he is now, he’s finally found peace.

**Discussion Questions**

•	Do you feel like Mac’s death changed this album for you from your initial perception of it? How so?

•	Where do you think Mac’s music would have gone from here?  There are so many different flavors he tried out on this thing that it makes me wonder how he would have followed it up

•	Would you want to see any posthumous material released from Mac?  For myself, the idea of an artist’s unreleased work coming out without them having a say in it has never sat right with me, but then again, I’m still hoping we might get to hear Pink Slime someday…

""I would imagine yo weird ass posted up somewhere just like this when you decided to make that disrespectful, narcissistic, jealous grossly unnecessary post. Why you would do it I can’t even understand It . maybe your belt was wrapped around your Gotdamn waist too tight or maybe it was the choker cutting the circulation off to the brain but since you felt it necessary to bring me up twice and my boy ain’t here to respond ima say it like this. You ain’t the first to make an album inspired by a relationship, you ain’t the first to make a song featuring Anderson .Paak but you are the first to disrespect my friend who is no longer here for absolutely no reason and I can’t stand for that. I’m not a tough guy I’m not about negativity but this bugged me bad bro. I’ve called you and dm’d and you havnt responded. So since this is what you like to do in order to get attention we can do it like this. You’re not surprised huh? Well I’m in disbelief!!! If Devine feminine was such a blue print of your record then tell me where the plaques are for whatever your shit was called!! Mac brought your ass on tour and opened up his fan base to you when you had nothing and this the type of appreciation you give? You should of just been grateful for the op! Whatever issues you had with Mac should have been addressed in person and ended there. what’s the point of bringing this up after his passing and disrespecting his name? You really woke up feeling like that was the move? That ain’t how you go about promoting whatever you got coming. Some things simply have nothing to do with you but when you have a God Complex im sure it’s easy to think everything comes from you or was inspired in some way. Whatever it is I ain’t giving it no more energy. I pray you get back to the music and spreading good energy, ima do the same. Mac Miller forever, love to his family and y’all have a blessed one.""

,"Obama criticizes Hip Hop in an interview for The Atlantic: ""I have to remind myself that if you listen to rap music, it’s all about the bling, the women, the money. A lot of rap videos are using the same measures of what it means to be successful as Donald Trump is.""",">**Goldberg:** You’re just surprised by the horse populism rode in on.

>**Obama:** Yes, and it’s this indication of parts of popular culture that I’ve missed. It’s interesting—people are writing about the fact that Trump increased his support among Black men [in the 2020 presidential election], and the occasional rapper who supported Trump. I have to remind myself that if you listen to rap music, it’s all about the bling, the women, the money. A lot of rap videos are using the same measures of what it means to be successful as Donald Trump is. Everything is gold-plated. That insinuates itself and seeps into the culture.

>Michelle and I were talking about the fact that although we grew up in very different places, we were both very much working-class, lower-middle-class, in terms of income, and we weren’t subject day-to-day to the sense that if you don’t have this stuff then you are somehow not worthy. America has always had a caste system—rich and poor, not just racially but economically—but it wasn’t in your face most of the time when I was growing up. Then you start seeing Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, that sense that either you’ve got it or you’re a loser. And Donald Trump epitomizes that cultural movement that is deeply ingrained now in American culture.

Lucas_The_Drummer,"Lil B just came out at Rolling Loud and cancelled his set, because A Boogie jumped him backstage","This the craziest shit. Lil B was added to the program, but just came out at the last minute and said that he can't do his set cause A Boogie With The Hoodie and his crew jumped him backstage and stole his shit. Apparently it's cause he said something about A Boogie's music. He came out and said it's still all love tho and new music soon but the set is cancelled and he's gonna go to the doctor.

EDIT: To add insult to injury, Lil B's set replaced Ski Mask. So neither of the sets that were supposed to happen at that time didn't. The crowd was chanting ""Fuck Boogie"" after Based God walked off

,"KANYE LIVE ON RADIO RIGHT NOW TALKING ABOUT DRAKE, ADIDON AND MORE","He called Drake insensitive, said he didn't supply Pusha with any info for Adidon and apologized for hurting people with his comments. One of the hosts teared up and got really emotional. Kanye started crying a  bit later as well when he mentioned Don C not being around as much anymore.

“People hang around your family and be in your house and then they get mad about a beat and send purple demon emojis” - About Drake

“Don’t pull me into the conversation. I didn’t (give information to Pusha T). I'm a family man, I got better things to do.” 


""Sometimes I don't feel the love - like when I come to Chicago and I hear three Drake records and no Ye records""



#LISTEN TO THE INTERVIEW BEFORE YOU FIRE UP YOUR KEYBOARDS AND START WRITING YOUR ESSAYS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW OF YOUR EXISTENCE. THOSE QUOTES ARE JUST A FEW SNIPPETS FROM THE INTERVIEW. IT'S NOT SMART TO WRITE AN ESSAY BASED ON JUST THOSE QUOTES. HE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF TOPICS AND ELABORATED ON A LOT OF THEM TOO.

WE ALL DIE ONE DAY AND YOU’RE OLD SO FUCK IT. YEA YEA MY 2013 PERFORMANCE AT THE GRAMMYS WAS ABSOLUTE SHIT. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, BLAH BLAH. THANKS FOR THE REMINDER. VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. FUCK THAT PERFORMANCE THOUGH. YOU THINK THAT’S WHY I KEPT MY WORK OUT OF THE GRAMMY PROCESS THIS YEAR? DON’T YOU THINK I WOULD’VE WANTED TO PLAY THE SHOW TO ‘REDEEM’ MYSELF IF I FELT THAT WAY? IN REALITY, I ACTUALLY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN HONORING PRINCE ON THE SHOW BUT THEN I FIGURED MY BEST TRIBUTE TO THAT MAN’S LEGACY WOULD BE TO CONTINUE TO BE MYSELF OUT HERE AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WINNING A TV AWARD DOESN’T CHRISTEN ME SUCCESSFUL. IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO LEARN THAT. I BOUGHT ALL MY MASTERS BACK LAST YEAR IN THE PRIME OF MY CAREER, THAT’S SUCCESSFUL. BLONDE SOLD A MILLION PLUS WITHOUT A LABEL, THAT’S SUCCESSFUL. I AM YOUNG, BLACK, GIFTED AND INDEPENDENT.. THAT’S MY TRIBUTE. I’VE ACTUALLY BEEN TUNING INTO CBS AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR FOR A WHILE TO SEE WHO GETS THE TOP HONOR AND YOU KNOW WHAT’S REALLY NOT 'GREAT TV’ GUYS? **1989 GETTING ALBUM OF THE YEAR OVER TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY. HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE MOST 'FAULTY’ TV MOMENTS I’VE SEEN**. BELIEVE THE PEOPLE. BELIEVE THE ONES WHO’D RATHER WATCH SELECT PERFORMANCES FROM YOUR PROGRAM ON YOUTUBE THE DAY AFTER BECAUSE YOUR SHOW PUTS THEM TO SLEEP. USE THE OLD GRAMOPHONE TO ACTUALLY LISTEN BRO, I’M ONE OF THE BEST ALIVE. AND IF YOU’RE UP FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CULTURAL BIAS AND GENERAL NERVE DAMAGE THE SHOW YOU PRODUCE SUFFERS FROM THEN I’M ALL FOR IT. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

Unrelated fact about Keem and writing refs, the reason Baby Keem says a bunch of nonsense on **""Praise God""** and has the line ""I signed a few ****** I polished their dreams"" is because his long verse was a writing reference for Kanye that he liked and just put in the song directly. the tame impala and bada ba boom stuff is just him trying to find a flow and was never meant to be released.",1652098377.0,misleading title,1247,/r/hiphopheads/comments/ulptqk/leaker_reveals_kendrick_lamar_ghostwrote_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/ulptqk/leaker_reveals_kendrick_lamar_ghostwrote_for/,6566,0.99

PmMeYourChromebook,Headliner Kid Cudi walks off stage at Rolling Loud Miami after fans throw things at the stage,"Kid Cudi was performing as the replacement headliner for Day 1 of Rolling Loud Miami. Kanye West was originally slated to headline but officially withdrew one week ago for unconfirmed reasons. Rolling Loud's selection of Kid Cudi as the replacement raised several eyebrows due to their ongoing public disagreements.

There is also a possibility the ""WHICH ONE?"" means ""which Pablo?"" (Picasso, Escobar, the one from Backyard Baseball, etc.)

Kanye West is claiming that his long awaited album ’Donda’ was uploaded to streaming services without his approval. According to Kanye his label Universal put it up without his permission, and that they also blocked Kanye from having the controversial song ’[Jail Pt 2](https://open.spotify.com/track/7f1w2rZoIf7g56McEUTh5W?si=5sZgpfGVTGyJGhdMrBfbPg&amp;amp;dl_branch=1) ’ on the album.

LanaWaynePac,"Pop Smoke murder appears to be a hit, not a robbery.","[https://www.tmz.com/2020/02/20/pop-smoke-murder-appeared-to-be-target-hit-not-robbery/](https://www.tmz.com/2020/02/20/pop-smoke-murder-appeared-to-be-target-hit-not-robbery/)

**Pop Smoke**'s death wasn't a robbery gone wrong ... it was a targeted hit ... and that conclusion is supported by surveillance video.

People  who have seen the surveillance footage from outside  the Hollywood  Hills home where Pop was killed Wednesday morning tell us  ... you see 4  men approach the home at around 4:30 AM and sneak around  back.

A  couple minutes pass before 3 of the 4 walk back up the side  of the  home to the front. The 4th apparently walked in the backdoor but  no  camera was trained on it. The next time you see the man, he exits   through the front door of the house.

As  we reported, multiple shots were fired inside the home and  they only  struck Pop Smoke, who was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical  Center where  he [**was pronounced dead**](https://www.tmz.com/2020/02/19/pop-smoke-dead-dies-20-murdered-home-invasion-robbery/).

At  first, it seemed like it might have been a robbery because  the rapper  posted a photo earlier in the day of a bunch of gifts ...  one of which  had his home address emblazoned on it. He also posted  another pic hours  before the shooting of himself and a friend in a car  .. the friend is  holding an enormous amount of cash.

But,  here's the thing. The folks who have seen the  surveillance video tell  us the person inside the house -- presumably the  shooter -- did not  carry anything out. Given that he shot someone, it's  doubtful he would  take the time to stuff items in his pocket.

Pop Smoke was only 20 and already making a name for himself in music. His song, ""Welcome to the Party"" was remixed by [**Nicki Minaj**](https://www.tmz.com/people/nicki-minaj/) and he appeared on [**Travis Scott**](https://www.tmz.com/people/travis-scott/)'s latest project ""JACKBOYS."" His album charted #7 Tuesday on the Billboard 200.

Cops continue to investigate the murder and have not arrested or named any suspects.

TLDR; 4 guys were seen at his house, only one went in the back door, shot him and came out the front door.",1582192230.0,,1021,/r/hiphopheads/comments/f6qtzu/pop_smoke_murder_appears_to_be_a_hit_not_a_robbery/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/f6qtzu/pop_smoke_murder_appears_to_be_a_hit_not_a_robbery/,6464,0.99

mellowtooth,"At the Madlib show in Denver tonight, Yasiin Bey (Mos Def) announces a Blackstar & Madlib album dropping 2018","I just got back from a Madlib DJ set in Denver, and Yasiin Bey made a surprise appearance, and announced a Blackstar & Madlib album dropping in 2018 - he even mentioned it several times. Yasiin showed up after performing elsewhere in Denver with Talib Kweli the same night.

For anyone curious about  the show itself, it had some of the best vibes i’ve experienced at a show - basically a giant 
smoke session with Madlib and Yasiin Bey, freestyling beats and some casual rhymes.

flvckojodyeII,Atlanta city councilman talks about how Lil Baby came to meet him and is shocked to see he is deeper than what he expected from his moniker and music. They then went to a BLM protest together,"Met a dope dude named Dominique. A brother whose seen struggle but also recognizes his divine power to call forth all that he seeks in life. When we first met he showed up in a worn black t-shirt, some joggers and [@balenciaga](https://www.instagram.com/balenciaga/) sneakers. No jewelry or entourage. His driver patiently waited outside while we talked for hours. I thought because everyone called him [@lilbaby\_1](https://www.instagram.com/lilbaby_1/) that he would have this huge ego and only care about superficial shit. Instead he spoke about how much he loved business, fashion and lifting up his community. He’s only been rapping for 3 years and has completely dismantled an industry. The hood he grew up in and the projects that raised him made him baby. A rebel with a cause, disrupting with a purpose bigger than himself. ⁣  
⁣  
The next day we marched down Mitchell Street with our fist in the air yelling - No Justice, No Peace as he leaned over and whispered in my ear, “this is what matters!” See he understood his calling was greater than the streets - it was to change the streets. To inspire the people to see beyond their environment and conditions that silently kept them unconsciously imprisoned. After marching for an hour, a white business owner brought out some waters to the crowd of walking protesters. As he was handing out the waters Lil Baby ran over to him and gave him $500. I looked up at him and smiled because if I was rich that’s something I would’ve done. As the protest came to an end, I watched in silent awe as [@troubleman31](https://www.instagram.com/troubleman31/) graciously walked up to him and greeted him like a King. It was inspiring to see one generation salute the next as they prepare to take their rightful place in Hip Hop. ⁣  
⁣  
Our generation is strong, we do not require someone to open a door for us because we understand our power to knock down any door that comes between us. When we speak we are casting spells, our tongue is powerful and through our vibrational energy are able to manifest into existence everything our spirit desires. Go forth into this world and live within the fullness of who God created you to be, and don’t let anyone tell you who you cannot be or what you cannot do. You are capable of ALL things, if you believe.

BoredBorderlineGeniu,Hiphop forum that dates back to 1993!,"[Link is here](http://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/alt.rap). Reading this often feels like hearing somebody say ""yo I just heard about this cool new underground band, it's called the Beatles you should check it out"". 

Some notable quotes:

- About MMLP on the day it came out: ""This will be the biggest selling hip hop album of all time""
- In 1996: ""**What could Canadians possibly rap about? Degrassi High?**""
- About Nas: ""I heard his next album is supposed to be called ""Still Illmatic""... when's he gonna learn he ain't NEVER gonna reproduce that ish? whatever... At least he should call it 'Stillmatic'""
- ""When is Dre going to make a new album? It’s been 3 years.
I know many people aren’t a bit interested, but I am, I like his shit.
And also, I was checking around, and I haven’t heard anywhere that he isn’t writing his own texts, like I heard somewhere around here. How do you know it and how can you be sure?""
- About Illmatic: ""This is a good album. This is a great album. This is probably the best debut to come out of New York since Black Moon’s “Enta Da Stage.” BUT, this is not the classic everybody’s been calling…for sure, everyone will be hypin' this album and 12"" of the singles will get mad play. But a classic? A classic debut? Like “People’s Instinctive Travels…” or “3 Feet High and Rising?” Naw man. Like “Criminal Minded” or “Paid In Full?”
C'mon.""

Or some people were horribly wrong too:

- ""JA RULE = NEXT TUPAC""
- ""And also heard new shit from Snoop Dogg
Dont know the name of it but it went something like 'Rolling down the street, Smoking Endo, Sipping on Pils'""
- people in 1995 were saying Wu Tang were “commercial trash for suburban white kids"" HOW???
- Anticipating Biggie's *Ready To Die*: ""personally i think it wont live up to the hype and he will be forgotten""

You can find *Illmatic* reviews on the day it came out, threads announcing the death of Tupac - and people being dicks about it: “hahahaha who cares” and “shut up, he was still human.. show some respect!!!”. Also, people were racist af. 

Edit: Yes I know *Illmatic* is a classic, hence I could have put the quote at the 'horribly wrong'-section. However, he still thought it was a great album and by comparison I don't think there were *that* many people calling GKMC or TPAB a classic on the day it came out. Sooo, he wasn't correct, but also not ""horribly wrong"" - it takes time for albums to become a cemented classic for everyone.

,21 Savage ICE Arrest Megathread,"[21 Savage was arrested by ICE yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/amtixa/21_savage_arrested_by_ice/)

>*ICE spokesman Bryan Cox: “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested unlawfully present United Kingdom national Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph AKA ‘21 Savage’ during a targeted operation with federal and local law enforcement partners early Sunday in metro Atlanta.”*

>*""Mr. Abraham-Joseph was taken into ICE custody as he is unlawfully present in the U.S. and also a convicted felon. Mr. Abraham-Joseph initially entered the U.S. legally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa”, Cox emailed*

>*More from ICE spokesman: “Mr. Abraham-Joseph is presently in ICE custody in Georgia and has been placed into removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts. ICE will now await the outcome of his case before a federal immigration judge to determine future actions.”*

>*BREAKING- @ICEgov spokesman tells me @21savage was taken into custody by ICE. “His whole public persona is false. He actually came to the U.S. from the U.K. as a teen and overstayed his visa.”  MORE COMING*

>*BREAKING- @21savage initially entered the U.S. legally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the U.S. when his visa expired in July 2006: @ICEgov*

>*Important new info on #21Savage arrest: am told it was NOT part of a SuperBowl -related ICE operation, that he was in car with [Young Nudy] who was subject of a local police bust @wsbtv*

>*The rapper’s attorney, Dina LaPolt, told Variety: “We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with authorities to clear up any misunderstanding. Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in the country — especially in Atlanta, Georgia and is actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.”*

>*BREAKING- @21savage was in the car with [Young Nudy] who was the target of a criminal arrest. 21 was taken into custody by law enforcement after they learned of his immigration status. “There is no misunderstanding. 21 Savage is a British National.”: Law Enforcement source*

>Akademicks: *Spoke to 21 savage team... this whole situation a big misunderstanding ... hope it gets cleared up quickly. There’s a logical explanation behind everything as well... but until then them U.K. jokes gonna fly.  When the real story comes out a lot will identify with it .*

**TL;DR:** ICE is claiming that he is a UK national and that he entered the US legally in 2005 (at the age of 12) and has overstayed his visa. [There were past reports that he's from Dominica, where ppl get UK citizenship](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8094198/tomi-lahren-21-savage-bank-account-video-reaction). He was arrested in an investigation into Young Nudy, for the same thing.

[This is following his performance of 'a lot' which mentions family separation by ICE](https://www.complex.com/music/2019/01/21-savage-a-lot-tonight-show-performance) (but it seems like he got caught bc of Nudy, not in retaliation to this)

Apple Music description:

> If you were hoping that an Eminem album released in 2020 would be less offensive, violent, or controversial, this album isn't for you. And the same can be said of this deluxe edition, released almost a year later, featuring 16 new tracks. In January, before the world entered lockdown, we were reacquainted with Eminem's chainsaw-wielding alter ego Slim Shady in an album as cold and uncompromising as the title suggests. And while some of us spent the year baking bread, watching TV, and chatting with friends online, Eminem pulled out his notepad. The extra tracks, released just before Christmas, carry all the aggressive, sinister, occasionally unacceptable themes we’ve come to expect from the legendary rapper. But they’re timestamped with references to the pandemic lexicon: social distancing, hand sanitizer, quarantine, etc. ""They say these bars are like COVID,"" he raps on 'Gnat.' ""You get 'em right off the bat.""

> Unlike his last two releases, this album is neither pop-leaning (with exception of one Ed Sheeran feature) nor a straight-up diss record. For better or worse, most of _Music to Be Murdered By_ is simply Eminem doing what he does best: gratuitously savage, antagonistic rhymes for the pure, juvenile sake of it. Longtime stans will rejoice to find three (!) collaborations with Royce da 5'9"", particularly the frenetic 'Yah Yah,' also featuring Q-Tip and Denaun. The beats on 'Stepdad' and 'Lock It Up' are second to none, while 'Little Engine' and 'Farewell' wouldn’t feel out of place on albums released two decades ago.

> But the world has changed in two decades. The divide between Eminem, lyrical savant and god of rap, and Slim Shady, a trigger-happy psychopath, has always been difficult to bridge. It’s harder to hear shock-value sucker punches about domestic violence and disability—least of all because they risk discrediting the genuinely powerful moments that Eminem is so uniquely capable of. The song worthy of the most discussion (and controversy), 'Darkness,' is one such moment: What begins as a tender, personal tale soon reveals itself to be the disturbing account of a man committing mass murder from a Las Vegas hotel room, before ending with a series of breaking-news voiceovers reporting on real-life mass murders throughout America. For all the wrath and bloodshed on _Music to Be Murdered By_, its most provocative song is its least fictional.",1608267281.0,,1944,/r/hiphopheads/comments/kfei65/fresh_album_eminem_music_to_be_murdered_by_bsides/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/kfei65/fresh_album_eminem_music_to_be_murdered_by_bsides/,6153,0.96

[Article](https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-kanye-west-anti-lgbtq-crusaders-prayer-rally-awaken-2020-20200115-h5vnq7albfa7td4443naerfesi-story.html):

>Kanye West will be featured as the headliner of Awaken 2020, a 10-hour-long prayer rally in Arizona, which is being billed as the “first epic evangelical stadium event of the decade.”

>West has announced that he will bring his gospel choir Sunday Service to the Jan. 18 event, which will take place at the Sun Devil Stadium in Phoenix, Ariz.

>The appearance by the hip-hop mogul is being seen by many in the Evangelical community as a way which will be used by God to “help spark the next national spiritual awakening in the United States,” according to Arizona-based conservative news site [The Western Journal.](https://www.westernjournal.com/kanye-west-headlining-stadium-event-aimed-igniting-national-spiritual-awakening/)

>According to the event’s page, organizers of Awaken 2020 are inviting participants to “open the door and enter into a new era, a new decade, of revival that is bringing a movement of signs and wonders, healing of the sick, and preaching of the gospel.”

>West will join a roster of high profile anti-LGBTQ cusaders in the ""monumental movement launching a new decade of awakening America back to God at a critical time in our nation’s history.”

>The long list of Evangelical celebrities include:

>- Ardent Trump defender **Guillermo Maldonado**, who has said that having same-sex relations is “clearly prohibited by God” and “invites unclean spirits into our lives,"" according to [the Advocate](https://www.advocate.com/election/2020/1/07/anti-lgbtq-extremists-evangelicals-trump);
>- **Ché Ahn**, who has said that LGBTQ equality “is not a civil rights issue” because they never had “rights taken from them,” as reported by [Right Wing Watch](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/kanye-west-joins-dominionist-pro-trump-prophets-for-stadium-prayer-rally/);
>- “Prophet"" **Cindy Jacobs** of Generals International, who has [warned](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/cindy-jacobs-if-equality-act-passes-christians-may-start-a-civil-war/) that passage of legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, the Equality Act, could lead the nation to “come to a place of civil war;”
>- **Lou Engle**, one of the more prominent players on the American religious right, according to the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/lou-engle), who has called homosexuality a “spirit of lawlessness,"" was a vocal proponent of Uganda’s “Kill the Gays” bill, and once claimed Nazism was fueled by homosexuality.

Cindy Jacobs and Guillermo Maldonado are two of the 12 keynote speakers, including Kanye. Others include Daniel Kolenda, Brian ""Head"" Welch, Jerame Nelson, Jake Hamilton, Jeremy Riddle, David & Stephanie Herzog, Eddie James, and Steve Swanson.

**Daniel Kolenda** is a missionary evangelist who has led more than 21-million people to Christ face-to face through massive open-air evangelistic campaigns in some of the most dangerous, difficult and remote locations on earth. As the successor to world renowned Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke, Daniel is the president and CEO of Christ for All Nations; a ministry which has conducted some of the largest evangelistic events in history, has published over 190 million books in 104 languages and has offices in 10 nations around the world. He also hosts an internationally syndicated television program.

**Dr. David & Stephanie Herzog** are the founders of David Herzog Ministries.

**Brian Welch**, also known by his stage name **Head**, is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is one of the guitarists and founding member of the nu metal band Korn. After becoming a born again Christian, Welch left the band in 2005 to focus on life as a father and to pursue his own solo career.

**Jerame Nelson** is a prophetic revivalist and the founder of Elisha Revolution. He is an author, as well as a well-known international conference speaker. It is Jerame's passion to equip the body of Christ in hearing God's voice and in walking in the supernatural power of God in every day life.

**Jake Hamilton** is an American Christian praise & worship singer and songwriter. Hamilton released the album entitled Marked By Heaven in 2009, which was his first full-length live album.

**Jeremy Riddle** is an American Christian musician, songwriter, and worship leader.

**Steve Swanson** travels around the world leading worship and training a generation of worshipers into abandoned joy and  fullness of glory.

Engle [appears to have previously been a headliner](https://www.evensi.us/awaken-2020-devil-football-stadium/312203565) but is no longer shown on the website. Same for Ché Ahn.

TheCosmicSerpent,I wish rappers would stop glorifying xanax,"Sorry if this breaks any rules but this shit really upsets me. I was in the car today, listening to *Moses* by French Montana, Chris Brown and Migos. It's got a great beat, catchy hook, etc... but Chris Brown's line really stuck out to me. 

""Pineapple Fanta it mix with the xanax, she lovin' the codeine""

Fuck, man. This is on the radio, uncensored. My 11 year old bro is in the car with me hearing this shit. I wish rappers would be a little more responsible when mentioning a drug like xanax, it makes codeine look like nothing. Both are bad habits on their own, but rapping about mixing them like that? 

Yams just died of this exact combo. ~~Xanax is a worse habit than heroin.~~ Xanax *withdrawal* is worse than heroin *withdrawal*. You'll spend months completely barred out, living in a lethargic stupor. It robs you of your soul. It's impossible for others to talk to you, because you forget the conversation you're having and re-start it a thousand times.

Of course it's not a rapper's responsibility to censor themselves for the sake of the children. I""m curious to see how the widespread use of xanax affects the culture of hip hop a few years from now when the tolls of this addiction sets in for those who are abusing it regularly. But it's completely fucked when 14 year olds are taking bars before school because that's the cool, new drug around. Hopefully it's just a phase like how ""molly"" was really big in rap for a while.

Thoughts?

**Edit: Let me clarify that I am not advocating artistic censorship. I do however believe that the radio stations should not allow the name brand of drugs to be mentioned on their airwaves. Why is ""he gotta eat the booty like groceries"" censored but ""mix xanax with lean"" isn't?**

**Edit 2: This has turned out to be a very productive discussion. Thank you all who have kept it civil and enlightening. For those of you who have blown up my DM's calling me a ""pussy ass faggot"" and ""bitch ass cracka,"" I don't really appreciate it but thanks for your input anyway**

hahaweednumber,Odd Future Mixtape Discography (900+ Songs 70+ Mixtapes),"This zip contains every Odd Future related release from 2006-2019. It should be mentioned that there are NO commercial releases here. Albums, like Igor or Some Rap Songs are both accessible on streaming sites and illegal to redistribute so I've left them out.

I created this for archival purposes as some of the stuff here is stupid rare and hopefully for Reddit users to discover new music they didn't know exists.

This project took me ~12 hours so I'd appreciate if you could check it out.

Shouts out to brandUn Deshay for hooking me up with some insanely rare songs and the Odd Future Talk forums for finding rare stuff ages ago.

Last night, Kevin Abstract of Brockhampton released a voice memo on his site in which he seems to express regret over the RCA deal and reflects on the last year of his work. The memo is now deleted but I've attached a mirror below.

https://reddit.com/link/bknnrv/video/dqj8bgy8d8w21/player

Some choice excerpts from the memo include

""Saturation 1, 2 and 3, was my moment of catching magic.""

""I'm currently writing music, and songs and albums from hell.""

""I have to release music not from joy but from obligation,  which will cause messy, unfinished work.""

I hope Kevin can get whatever help that will cause him to feel more normal and adapted to his fame and obligations. It will be interesting to see if the RCA deal will already be dissolved this soon.",1556991682.0,,597,/r/hiphopheads/comments/bknnrv/in_a_now_deleted_voice_memo_kevin_abstract_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/bknnrv/in_a_now_deleted_voice_memo_kevin_abstract_of/,5898,0.98

I don't know if he actually knows these girls ages or not, and he may have done his due diligence but I found it a bit creepy and wanted to know if anybody else had more info about this.

scottsamonster,Charlemagne confesses to drugging a woman in 2015 podcast,"[**Audio**](https://youtu.be/zVjEKi9le-0?t=1610). I thought it'd be good to share this in light of the  rape accusation.

**Here's a transcript of the important part:**

Charlamagne: Listen man, you just never know... Its a lot of gray areas when it comes to that shit man... a lot of gray area. 

Andrew: yes there are gray areas but if you're unconscious you rape somebody, and thats plain and simple, and theres nothing you can do around that, if you're unconscious...even if she's drinking, even if she's tired b she ran a marathon that day... if she passes out and she's unconscious now and you fuck her, that's rape... Now, this is a weird thing that has been said to me by multiple girls actually, uh they go ""you know what'd be fun, is we woke up in the morning, and you were like already fucking me..."" I'm like, you mean raping you? WTF why you trying to get me caught up? Doesn't that sound like a set up? That's how I'm in jail for 10yrs because of some fantasy that you had. You never had a girl say that? Like how we just wake up... 

Charlamagne: I remember a scenario in Myrtle Beach, South Caroline, I got this girl real drunk, and uhm, I fucked, we fucked. 

Andrew: ... just that sentence sounds a little fishy, ""I got her drunk against her will..."" 

Charlamagne: Nah I did. Now I didn't just get her drunk I went to the sex store and got Spanish Fly. 

Andrew: Oh so you raped her? 

Charlamagne: Shut up. Spanish Fly. They sell it in the sex store, I'm telling the truth... they sell it in the Spanish store. I had the fucking... I mean they sell it in the sex store. 

Andrew: Why you snitching on you dog? They sell knives in the store too, you can put that to a girls throat, and have sex with her, doesn't mean its legal. 

Charlamagne: So I put the spanish fly in the E&J, we drinking the E&J and shit... so in my mind I don't know if this shit really work, but I feel like I got horny as a motherfucker too! Right? Right? 

Andrew: You took it too? 

Charlamagne: So she was drunk and shit, and we had sex and shit, and like a lot of my boys were trying to come in the room and fuck her and I'm like nah chill out, we not doing that, I'm not gonna let y'all run a train on her, that's rape. So, right, so, so... 

Andrew: If its just one on one, its ain't rape. Trains are rape. 

Charlamagne: So the next morning, the next morning she wakes up and uhm, we talk about it. And she's like ""What happened?"" I'm like ""We had sex."" she said ""Ok well I'm glad it was you."" Then a couple days later, she's like ""Yo are you sure I only had sex with you?"" Because one of my stupid ass cousins was going around saying he fucked her, which he didn't, I know for a fact he didn't. I was there with her the whole time. He did not fuck her. He looked at her naked, but he didn't fuck her. Right? So, so, so... I'm telling her no me and you just had sex, nobody else did nothing. So it just was weird that she was like, ""I'm just glad it was you."" You know what I'm saying, because in mind yea you could have been in a real bad situation if it was another motherfucker there... 

Andrew: That's a huge compliment man. A girl just said, ""yo at least you raped me."" 

Charlamagne: I didn't rape her. I did not rape her. I did not rape her. 

Andrew: If it was any of your cousins or friends... it would have been rape. 

Charlamagne: I didn't rape her, because me and her had every intention of having sex with each other. 

Andrew: So then why would you put the Spanish Fly? 

Charlamagne: I was a freaky... I'm still a freaky motherfucker but I was really, I was... listen I was... my whole... 

Andrew: Wait, was she passed out when you fucked her? 

Charlamagne: Nah... she wasn't like. She was like one of those drunks where listen, no listen, no, she was one of those drunks where like, she was like one of those drunks where she was like oh, coher... she wasn't coherent, but she was up, like when your girl... like when you're blacked up like that don't know what the fuck is going on type shit, like she was really fucked up... 

Andrew: She was awake and she was into it? 

Charlamagne: She was wasted. Yea. She was wasted. 

Andrew: Her eyes were not rolling in the back of her head? 

Charlamagne: Nah nah nah nah... she was 

Andrew: Ok was she snoring while you were having sex? 

Charlamagne: It was just weird because while we were having sex, she was... because one of my homeboys used to fuck her on the regular. When I say the regular, the regular... that was his girl. He hates me probably to this day. 

Andrew: Wait, so you fucked your friends girl? 

Charlamagne: I was a piece of shit. It wasn't his girl tho, it was like a girl he used to really love. So this is the whole story... The girl was white right, and he was black... so this is in Monks Corner, South Carolina... they couldn't really have an inter-racial relationship at the time, dixie flag flying over and shit, right, they couldn't be... it couldn't really go down. So they couldn't really claim each other, you know what I'm saying... but it was one of those weekends she just mad at the motherfucker, and came to get drunk with me, and I had been flirting with her, and we had been talking on the phone, we kiss every now and then. 

Andrew: This is your boy's girl... 

Charlamagne: This is my boy's... He should have claimed her. 

Andrew: Which boy? 

Charlamagne: I'm not saying.. 

Andrew: Do I know him? 

Charlamagne: Nah you don't know him. He should have claimed her. 

Andrew: Was he at your wedding? 

Charlamagne: Hell no. Absolutely not. But its like, we knew it was going to happen but it was just the fact that it could have been really bad for her, is my point. The fact that she woke up the next day and was like ""I'm just glad it was you, and just you."" was weird to me... that was a little strange. 

Andrew: I like the fact that you made yourself a hero in this story. 

Charlamagne: I did. I'm the Dr. Dre. I wrote... I wrote this... straight out of Monks corner. I wrote this. 

Andrew: Sweetheart they was trying to come in the room... they were trying, after I drugged you and you passed out... they were trying to come in and get some pussy but I said no. 

Charlamagne: I did not drug her, and pass out.... ",1531436819.0,,1085,/r/hiphopheads/comments/8yeok2/charlemagne_confesses_to_drugging_a_woman_in_2015/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/8yeok2/charlemagne_confesses_to_drugging_a_woman_in_2015/,5748,0.97
