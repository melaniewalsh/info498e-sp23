Shan-Yu\\'s falcon swoops\\r\\ndown and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands\\r\\non top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One\\r\\ngrappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge\\r\\nand sees many grappling hooks coming towards him]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuard [yelling]:  We\\'re under attack!  Light the signal!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long\\r\\nHair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with\\r\\nhis sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to\\r\\nlight the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at\\r\\nhim across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron\\r\\nlighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons\\r\\none by one]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you\\'re here.\\r\\n\\r\\nShan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li\\r\\nwalks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. \\r\\nHe bows, then looks up]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu:  Impossible!

She ties a stick\\r\\nonto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother\\'s face. \\r\\nShe ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother\\r\\nbegins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for\\r\\nLittle Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. \\r\\nLittle brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Mulan\\'s Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family\\'s\\r\\nancestors]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Zhou:  Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain\\r\\naround the floor]: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the\\r\\ngrain]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Zhou:  Please, PLEASE, help her.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to\\r\\nget the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the\\r\\nbone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the\\r\\ntemple]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [calling out]: Father I brought your--whoop!  [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan. \\r\\nThe cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of\\r\\nhis cane]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Zhou:  Mulan--\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  I brought a spare.

I wont let you down. \\r\\n[Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve]  Wish me luck. \\r\\n[Mulan hurries down the stairs]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Zhou [calling out]:  Hurry!  [to himself] I\\'m going to...pray some more.\\r\\n[Fa Zhou turns and walks back into the temple]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried]\\r\\n\\r\\nBath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? \\r\\nThe matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for\\r\\nluck.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be,\\r\\nthey\\'re dead.  Besides,  I\\'ve got all the luck we\\'ll need.  [Speaking to\\r\\nCri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. \\r\\nGrandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two\\r\\nhorse and carriage collide causing a big accident.

[Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had\\r\\nto--\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Li:  None of your \\'xcuses.  Now let\\'s get you cleaned up.

We\\'ll\\r\\nneed more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to the hair dressers]\\r\\n\\r\\nHair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan\\'s hair much to Mulan\\'s chagrin]:\\r\\nWait and see\\r\\nWhen we\\'re through\\r\\n\\r\\nHair Dresser 2:\\r\\nBoys will gladly go to \\r\\nwar for you\\r\\n\\r\\nHair Dresser 1:\\r\\nWith good fortune \\r\\n\\r\\nHair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]:\\r\\nAnd a great hairdo\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth:\\r\\nYou\\'ll bring honor to us all\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Li and others:  [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and\\r\\npauses to make an impressive move.

Not looking\\r\\npleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her\\r\\nforehead and smiles]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan\\'s hair]:  There, you\\'re\\r\\nready.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet!

[Cri-Kee escapes from\\r\\nhis cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. \\r\\n[Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her]\\r\\nRecite the final admonition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.

Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker\\r\\ngrabs Mulan\\'s right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and\\r\\nleaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a\\r\\nteapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a\\r\\nsense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at\\r\\nMatchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours\\r\\nthe tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.

She bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face\\r\\nas she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa] [with anger]  You are a disgrace! \\r\\n[Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to pieces]  You may look like a\\r\\nbride, but you will never bring your family honor!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan.  She looks\\r\\nsorrowful.  Fa Zhou sees his daughter and smiles.  Mulan sees her father\\'s\\r\\nsmile.

[Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Am I late?\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [while feeding Mulan]:  No time to talk.  Now remember, it\\'s your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play\\r\\nnice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid\\'s butt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [with her mouth full of food]:  But I don\\'t wanna kick the other kid\\'s butt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  Don\\'t talk with your mouth full.  Now let\\'s see your war face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]. \\r\\nI think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C\\'mon scare me, girl! \\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [swallows the food]:  Rrrrrrr!\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]:  Oh, that\\'s my tough looking warrior.

[The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.

[All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang\\r\\nPoints arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nYao [bows to Shang]:  I\\'ll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I\\'ll do it with my shirt on.  [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it\\r\\nhigh speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao\\'s\\r\\narm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while\\r\\nMulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.

Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu\\r\\npoints at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [angrily]:  What happened?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [stumbling]:  Uhhh--\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we\\'re--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the\\r\\narrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows\\r\\nstart hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  Save the cannons!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him\\r\\nfrom bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan\\r\\nfree from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet\\r\\nand sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  Oh sure, save the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.

They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  Fire!\\r\\n\\r\\n[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu\\'s army hides]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  Fire!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.

Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare\\r\\nto fight.  If we die, we die with honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang\\'s position.

She rushes forward]\\r\\n\\r\\nYao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]:  Hey.\\r\\n<b> \\r\\n</b>Shang:  Ping, come back.  Ping!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.

Quickly!  Quickly!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse.  Shan-Yu\\'s falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock]\\r\\n\\r\\nYao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]:  C\\'mon, we\\'ve gotta help.  [they charge towards Mulan\\'s position]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands\\r\\non the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]:  You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in\\r\\nfront of you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and\\r\\nShan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]\\r\\n\\r\\nShan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]:  Yrrrrrrraah.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu\\'s horse stumbles. \\r\\nMulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his\\r\\nhorse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him\\r\\naround and helping him run away from the avalanche]\\r\\n\\r\\nYao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]:  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn\\r\\naround and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up\\r\\nShan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan\\'s position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She\\r\\ngrabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.

Now I\\'ll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope\\r\\ncompletely passed through his hands]--ty.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]:  Hey Mulan, I found a lucky\\r\\ncricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [speaking loudly]:  We need help!  [Yao\\'s arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they\\'re about to fall\\r\\nover the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We\\'re gonna die!  We\\'re gonna die!  I know we\\'re gonna die!  No way we can\\r\\nsurvive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao]\\r\\n\\r\\nYao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers.

The bravest of us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nYao [lifting his arm high]:  You\\'re king of the mountain!\\r\\n\\r\\nChien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes!\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  Ping, what\\'s wrong?  [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly] \\r\\nHe\\'s wounded, get help!  [Ping starts to pass out.  The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] \\r\\nPing, hold on.  Hold on.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to outside of the medic tent.  Mulan and Medic are inside.  Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite\\r\\nconcerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and\\r\\ngoes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to\\r\\nfall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang\\'s surprised look and realizes her feminine form is\\r\\nnoticeable]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh,  I can explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu [stepping into the tent]:  Huh?  So it\\'s true.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]:  Shang!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to outside the tent.  Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm.  Mulan uses her other hand to hold the blanket]\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu:  I knew there was something wrong with you.

Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes\\r\\nhis blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn\\'t get warm, he\\r\\nmoves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks\\r\\nup a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father\\'s life.  Who knew you\\'d end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all\\r\\nyour friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he\\'s about to cry].\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Maybe I didn\\'t go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror\\r\\n[picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I\\'d see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the\\r\\nhelmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that\\'s because this just needs a little spit, that\\'s all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping\\r\\nthe spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by\\r\\nhis actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we\\'re both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don\\'t even like me.  I mean,\\r\\nyou risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles].\\r\\n\\r\\nCri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  What!?

Mulan slides away. \\r\\nShan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the\\r\\nshirt collar]\\r\\n\\r\\nShan-Yu [in Shang\\'s face]:  You, you took away my victory.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan\\'s shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet.  Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  No!  I did!  [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]\\r\\n\\r\\nShan-Yu [looking at Mulan]:  The soldier from the mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and\\r\\nthrough the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right\\r\\nbehind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. \\r\\nMulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu\\'s falcon like a horse\\r\\ncatches up with Mulan]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  So what\\'s the plan?\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Ummmm.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  You don\\'t have a plan?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Hey, I\\'m making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go. \\r\\nMushu--\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  I\\'m way ahead of you sister.  C\\'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use\\r\\nthe wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword\\r\\nwildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. \\r\\nMulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu\\'s reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column\\r\\ncausing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes\\r\\nto a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to\\r\\nher right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework\\r\\nlighters) on the edge of the tower] \\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  Citizens, I need firepower.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarry Cook:  Who are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]:  You\\'re\\r\\nworst nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest]\\r\\n\\r\\nMan in Crowd #1:  On the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan in Crowd #2:  Look!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks\\r\\nthrough the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her\\r\\nperson to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]\\r\\n\\r\\nShan-Yu:  It looks like you\\'re out of ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through\\r\\nthe fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that\\r\\nShan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping\\r\\noff the fan with her sword movement]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu?\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a\\r\\nstick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who\\'s standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights\\r\\nthe fuse]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in\\r\\nthe face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and\\r\\nstabs it into Shan-Yu\\'s cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan\\r\\nlies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to\\r\\nrun, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly\\r\\npropelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the\\r\\nrocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu\\'s tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the\\r\\nroof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to\\r\\nfly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs\\r\\nonto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and\\r\\nreleases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the\\r\\nground.  Shan-Yu\\'s sword follows and lands on the ground near by]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah\\r\\nha ha ha ha.  [Mushu\\'s catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to\\r\\nCri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee\\'s antenna]\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate\\r\\nattempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she\\'s done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push\\r\\nMulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature\\'s not worth protecting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [in Chi Fu\\'s face]:  She\\'s a hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu:  \\'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous--\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor [walking down the steps]:  That is enough!\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  Your Majesty, I can explain.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear\\r\\npath to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look\\r\\nwaits to write down the words of the Emperor]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor:  I\\'ve heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father\\'s armor, ran away\\r\\nfrom home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,\\r\\ndestroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  [the Emperor bows to Mulan]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. \\r\\nShang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing\\r\\nwhat she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the\\r\\nground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  My little baby\\'s all grown up and savin\\' China.  [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor:  Chi Fu,\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu:  Your Excellency?\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor:  See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu [muttering to himself]:  A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]\\r\\nwhat? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor [to Mulan]:  Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu].\\r\\n\\r\\nChi Fu [wobbling to and fro]:  What?...My...[faints]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]:  With all due respect, your Excellency.  I\\r\\nhave been away from home long enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor [taking off his pendant]:  Then take this, so your family will know what you have done\\r\\nfor me.  And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu]  so the world will know what you have done\\r\\nfor China.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]\\r\\n\\r\\nYao:  Is she allowed to do that?  [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts\\r\\nall three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground\\r\\nagain.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan\\r\\nstarts to smile anticipating something good]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang:  Um...[Mulan grins]  You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan mounts Khan]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Khan, let\\'s go home.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground\\r\\nlevel.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [dumbfounded]:  Sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor:  You don\\'t meet a girl like that ev\\'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks\\r\\nback up the steps to his palace]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to Mulan\\'s home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands\\r\\non his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her\\r\\napproaching and starts to stand]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Zhou:  Mulan.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of\\r\\nthe Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They\\'re gifts to honor the Fa\\r\\nFamily.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. \\r\\nHe bends down and holds her arms outstretched]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan\\'s\\r\\ntear then hugs Mulan]  I\\'ve missed you so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  I\\'ve missed you too Baba.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]\\r\\n\\r\\nFa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a\\r\\nma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [just arriving]:  Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Grandma Fa\\'s mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan\\'s position.  Shang walks\\r\\ntoward Mulan and Fa Zhou]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandma Fa:  Woo, sign me up for the next war.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]:  Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. \\r\\nShang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet.  Ah but well, actually\\r\\nit\\'s your helmet, isn\\'t it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over.  Mulan holds the helmet Shang offers]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Would you like to stay for dinner?\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandma Fa [speaking from stage right]:  Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head with a\\r\\nsmile at Grandma Fa\\'s statement]\\r\\n\\r\\nShang [reassuredly to Mulan]:  Dinner would be great.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window.  He watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa\\r\\nZhou.  Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor\\'s his head]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [tugging on First Ancestor\\'s ear]:  C\\'mon, who did a good job?  C\\'mon, tell me who did a\\r\\ngood job.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Ancestor [hesitantly]:  Oh, all right.  You can be a guardian again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh.  [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the\\r\\nancestors]\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu:  Take it Cri-Kee.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Song:  True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Ancestor 1 does a dance from Pulp Fiction while Ancestor 3 does the Hand Jive]\\r\\n\\r\\nAncestor 3 [spoken to Ancestor 1]:  She get\\'s it from my side of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nMushu [spoken while swinging on a chain]:  Call out for egg rolls!\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Ancestor [disgusted]:  Guardians.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple.  Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on the\\r\\nsteps]\\r\\n\\r\\nMulan:  Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead].\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Brother:  Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark  \\r\\n\\r\\n[Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him.  The\\r\\nchickens follow him in]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Ancestor [annoyed]:  Mushu!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Roll Credits]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The End]\\r\\n\\r\\n</pre><br>\\r\\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\\r\\n  <tr> \\r\\n\\t<td align=center>\\r\\n\\t<td><h1>Mulan</h1><br><br>\\r\\n\\t    <b>Writers</b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Robert D.
