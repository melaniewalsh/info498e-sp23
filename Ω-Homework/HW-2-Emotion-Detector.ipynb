    "In this homework assignment, you will be building your own \"emotion detector\" Python function, which will be able to read in any .txt file and print out the sentences that contain a certain emotion from that file. To do so, you will use the Python package VADER and its \"polarity scores\" (specifically, the compound score) to determine whether the sentence matches the emotion (this is an admittedly crude method). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to decide what \"emotion\" or \"sentiment\" you want to capture — maybe it's \"elation\" or \"very positive\" or \"very negative\" or \"nonchalant.\" Then you need to decide how you will measure that emotion or sentiment using VADER's \"compound\" scores (-1 to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, your function should accept a given .txt filename and return or print all the sentences that match the chosen emotion/sentiment next to the actual compound score for each sentence and a line break. You can earn 1 extra bonus point if you return or print only a select number of sentences based on a threshold (for example, the top 10 most positive or negative sentences from the text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things that you will need to do inside your function: read in the text file, split the text into sentences, consider each sentence and get its compound score with VADER, figure out if the sentence matches the emotion you're looking for, print or return the sentence plus the compound score and a line break if it matches."
